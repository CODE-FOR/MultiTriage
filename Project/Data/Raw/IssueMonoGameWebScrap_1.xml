    <Description>I've created a new MonoGame project (Windows DX) and Content Pipeline project (.Net Standard 2.0) using the default templates.

I've got a minimum reproduction here:  Here Game1 is the ContentPipeline project and Game2 is the Windows DX project. I added a reference to `Game1.dll` to `Content.MGCB` but when I try to select a content importer or processor I don't get the option to select `Importer1` or `Processor1` while both are defined in the `Game1` project. The `Game1` project builds without problems.

I've tried several of my other project, and no matter what I do, after upgrading to MonoGame 3.8 I can't select my custom content processors/importers anymore. 

If an asset in a project already had the right references and a custom importers/processor set they no longer build. Giving an error like: 'Failed to create processor `MyFooProcessor`. Unfortunately I don't get any more logging, is there a place I can take a peek?

I tried to build and run it inside my windows 7 vm and nothing happens. No error, no window appeared, nothing. 

On my windows 10 vm, dx and gl versions works fine but it runs around 30-40 fps. My dx11 program runs over 60fps. So maybe there's a problem with dx11 implementation?

I tried making an empty scene in unity and runs in both of my vm and it works perfectly. Stable at 60fps in vsync on.

When using the old XNA DrawIndexedPrimitives function below, everything works fine:

Am I missing something, as it would appear the new function is just a shorter version of its older counterpart, but it doesn't seem to work or something else is needed (apart from setting the buffers) to make it work?

After installing MonoGame 3.8, when I created an empty Game project on WindowsDX, (or DesktopGL) , I found out that
I saw a yellow caution mark on the package dependencies and it seems the package is not installed correctly.

Those packages are two of the following:
 MonoGame.Content.Buider.Task (3.8.0.1641)
 MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX (3.8.0.1641)

The cases I've encountered seem to be rare, and most people seem to be working correctly, and I didn't find anyone writing about the same problem. I checked the activity log for error output.
When running mgcb, I got the error “The MonoGame content tools only work on a 64-bit OS.”
But my OS is Windows 10 Pro (64bit).
I thought dotnet.exe was suspicious and looked at my PATH and found it in C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet.
I removed that directory from my PATH and made sure my PATH was in the 64bit dotnet.exe file, and then I found the created When I opened the project, I was able to build it with no errors!

I would like to see a fix so that when VS2019 starts mgcb via dotnet.exe, the 64-bit version of dotnet.exe does start correctly and no cause problems.

Hello Monogame community. First of all, I don't know exacly if it is a bug or not. For me it looks more like the way VS compiler handles and builds the assemblies or maybe I have done something wrong. For this, I have decided to write this issue to warn the others about this problem and even learn something new.

I've reproduced it on the current build (3.8.0.1641) and haven't tested the same thing on previous ones.

My solution is designed like this:

Project 1 - Game Project &lt;- All contents are here. Content.Load&lt;Song&gt;() is also called in this project.
Project 2 - Library Project

Where game contains a reference for the library project and both contains a reference for Monogame assemblies. Initially I was testing my game's performance on DesktopGL and then I have decided to compare it on WindowsDX.
I have updated the Game Project reference to WindowsDX, but I forgot to update the Library's reference to WindowsDX. And that was my mistake. For my surprise the Game Project's Content.Load&lt;Song&gt; was using it's DesktopGL version and was attempting to open songs as OGG instead WindowsDX's WMA.

I believe the exception is well know here: System.IO.InvalidDataException: 'Could not determine container type!'.

Just running the sample code, NO MODIFICATIONS (I need to stress that as I did get the notice "learn to code" before when I was trying to run unmodified code without much success), just created the template with the new project wizard, and run, and this is what I got... 

Interesting to note are the two warning triangles in the dependencies tree, which looks to me like the source of all evil here. Now all information I got is exit code 1, and what that means (Okay, Googling that code says "path not found"... which path and why that path is needed I do not know) is guessing work.

I just freshly installed VS2019, installed MonoGame onto it, in order to test things out (which I always do with new programming languages, new libraries, frameworks, or whatever development tool, thing, whatever), and well, the above happened as soon as I click the "Create" button. 

Now the above was tried as "Universal", so let's try Desktop, and well, what happens is the same:

When you run the mgcb-editor register command on a Mac a second time, it results in an exception because the .plist file already exists.
While granted this shouldn't be needed, the error should be a lot more use friendly and not an exception.

After upgrading from 3.8.0.1375-develop to 3.8.0.1641, RenderTarget2D.GetSharedHandle(); throws a null reference exception.

It was working fine with the develop version.

    <Description>The MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task will not execute properly if MGCBPath contains a space, for example if the current user has a name that includes a space. For me MGCBPath is set to `C:\Users\FirstName LastName\.nuget\packages\monogame.content.builder.task\3.8.0.1641\build\\..\tools\netcoreapp3.1\any\mgcb.dll`. This results in an invalid command in the builder task since the MGCBPath is included without quotations.

The issue is a point of confusion for new people and for reference potentially leading to a failed registration of the pipeline tool.

Under getting started.

found here.


At the bottom of the page marked Optional which (should be marked Recommended).
Seen before the more detailed instructions with cavets for installing and registering the pipeline tool later on.

&gt; 
&gt; To register the MGCB Editor tool with Windows and Visual Studio 2019, run the following from the Command-Prompt.
&gt; 
&gt; dotnet tool install --global dotnet-mgcb-editor
&gt; mgcb-editor --register


Doesn't match the more detailed instructions.

Found at the bottom here.


&gt; The MGCB Editor is published as a .NET Core tool, Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed if you wish to install the editor. You can download it here.
&gt; 
&gt; In a command prompt/terminal window, run the following command to install the MGCB Editor:
&gt; 
&gt; dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb-editor
&gt; 
&gt;     For development branches, you will need to ensure you have the dev channel NuGet registered and include the version number in the command, for example:
&gt; 
&gt;     dotnet nuget add source -n MonoGame 
&gt; 
&gt;     dotnet tool install --global dotnet-mgcb-editor --version 3.8.0.1476-develop
&gt; 
&gt; After installing mgcb-editor run the following to register the MGCB Editor as the default app for mgcb files.
&gt; 
&gt; mgcb-editor --register

People using the new version and 2019 are going to use the first set of instructions which can fail.
They may not read further to the segment titled tools editor when it doesn't work for the next step after getting started in sequence.

1) Their should **only** be one area for installation instructions for any specific thing listing all possible configurations and cavets.
2) Other places where there is a required awareness of these instructions should linked to that location.
3) If the majority of use cases apply to a specific topic or a link.
Then that item should **not** be marked _optional_ but instead either Suggested, Recommended, Standard, or Requisite reading.   

Something that implys that you should now click to here to ensure you have set everything up for your platform.

The options PreferredBackBufferWidth and PreferredBackBufferHeight appears to be no longer working after upgrading to 3.8. I tried this on a new project. Was there some kind of change or is there another way to change window size?

`public Game1() {
    // not working
    _graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager( this ) {
        PreferredBackBufferWidth = 512
        , PreferredBackBufferHeight = 512
    };
    Content.RootDirectory = "Content";
    IsMouseVisible = true;

    // not working either
    this._graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 512;
    this._graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 512;
    this._graphics.ApplyChanges( );

In order to simplify Effects management, there's a number of interfaces that abstract the way effects are setup, these include: IEffectMatrices, IEffectFog, etc.

I would like to add yet another interface for the collection, with this definition:

``

This interface would be implemented by SkinnedEffect.

It's a trivial addition, so if there's agreement I can do the pull request myself.

Starting a discussion to get a heads of agreement on a plan to update the samples to 3.8

My initial thoughts are as follows:

* Review and close-out existing PR's for 3.7
* Commit current examples to a 3.7 branch
* Update develop branch samples to 3.8
* Create an updated sample template using 3.8 pattern
* Review new samples for 3.8

Whilst reviewing the API documentation, there seems to be two conflicting/overlapping namespaces in the MonoGame codebase, which could lead to confusion:

MonoGame.Framework.Utilities
MonoGame.Utilities

IMHO, there should only be a single MonoGame Utilities namespace to avoid confusion
(There is also a MonoGame.Utilities.Deflate namespace that will need aligning)

Given the breaking nature of MonoGame 3.8, it would be advisable to align these for the 3.8 release.

When opening a prompt to enter text (e.g. Create New Folder) in the MGCB-Editor, The Editor should focus on the Text box so the user can start typing straight away instead of having to select the text box first.

For Example:

1. Open MGCB-Editor
2. Create New Content Project
3. Right-Click in project and select "New Folder"

Expectation:
User should be able to just type the folder name and hit enter

Actual:
User has to move the mouse or tab multiple times to put the input box in focus before typing and then pressing enter.

I have recently given MonoGame and MonoDevelop a try for game development, but I decided to uninstall. I managed to uninstall MonoGame and MonoDevelop, but for some reason the MonoGame Pipeline Tool icon still persists. When I right-click to Show Details about the icon, the Ubuntu software manager says it doesn't exist. Typing `whereis mono` yields `mono: /usr/lib/mono /etc/mono` and sudo rm -rf'ing doesn't seem to do the trick. How can I completely uninstall and clear all mono-related files and folders?

On MonoGame 3.7 whenever I make changes to shaderpart.hlsl the content pipeline automatically builds shader.fx on the next build. However on MonoGame 3.8.0.1469-develop this does not happen. And I have to make a change to shader.fx before it will build again. 

I guess the content processor for fx files no longer adds an `ExternalReference` for external files included in shaders?

Edit: I think I found the commit that broke this. In https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/commit/4e48966a00a4833d802d284ff395c6b54417a605#diff-e31429c4281a413276a0b823cdf19e38 the following few lines of code have been removed/replaced in `EffectProcessor.cs`


            // Parse the MGFX file expanding includes, macros, and returning the techniques.	
            ShaderResult shaderResult;	
            try	
            {	
                shaderResult = ShaderResult.FromFile(options.SourceFile, options, 	
                    new ContentPipelineEffectCompilerOutput(context));	

                // Add the include dependencies so that if they change	
                // it will trigger a rebuild of this effect.	
                foreach (var dep in shaderResult.Dependencies)	
                    context.AddDependency(dep);	
            }

I've got an extremely simple netstandard2.0 project referencing the latest `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` package

``

In this case I cannot use any of the MonoGame/XNA classes:

`The type or namespace name 'Xna' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft' (are you missing an assembly reference?)`

I can fix this by either:
- Using the GL version of the package
- Using target framework netcoreapp3.1

So far I have been unable to figure out why this happens.

On the current Pipeline Tool install instructions, there is an issue in the instructions:


Currently, it states 
``

The two issue with this (once which will disappear on 3.8 release) are:

- Currently the "dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb-editor" will fail without a --version argument as there is no release version.  This will go away with the release, but the "Development" version testing will need to ensure to include this argument

- "dotnet mgcb-editor --register" is highlighted in the instructions as the command to register the MGCB tool, which is incorrect.  The line should read:

&gt; **After installing mgcb-editor, run "mgcb-editor --register" from the command prompt to register MGCB Editor as the default app for .mgcb files. This currently does not work on macOS.**


Additionally, the Extended Pipeline Tool docs also need updating with the 3.8 release



Tasks:

[ ] update Install docs
[ ] update readme docs
[ ] update MonoGame Installation guides

I installed 3.8 and now I'm unable to start the Pipeline tool, I've tried:

* From VS
* Doble clicking mgcb file
* Manually from Start menu
* As administrator
* From command prompt

The window simply fails to open (does appear to try and run but fails)

Are there any logs or command-line overrides that can be used to get more details as to why it's not starting?

I uninstalled 3.8 and reinstalled the latest 3.7.1 and confirmed that build does indeed run.

P.S. Will try from source later.

See [this forum post](

I haven't experienced this myself, but it looks like there are issues loading the Assimp64 lib on Windows and Linux with the new MGCB.Task and this should probably be fixed for 3.8.

I believe it's related to the working directory changing in the new task, and maybe caused by Assimp loading native libraries based on working directory instead of relative path, since copying Assimp64.dll to the MGCB working directory fixed this on Windows.

On Visual Studio 2019, Windows SDK 18362 is the default that is installed by the Visual Studio Installer. MonoGame is still targeting Windows SDK 17763 though... Is there any specific reason for that?

    <Description>Hi,

I did not check if this issue is appearent in the development branch, but suffice to say, the thing I encounterd was weird.

So, I programmed a shooter where you controll a space ship and i tried to have the game play a sound effect when shooting, I needed to figure out a process so the sound wouldnt play at full speed allways, only when I pressed the controller a button or the space bar, the ship is controllable with the arrow keys and wasd.

Now, I made it so that boolean variables would detect when the player lifted the A button or the space bar and when it was pressed, so the sound wouldnt play over and over again, just from a light tap.

After tried to test my solution, which i implemented for controller as well as keyboard, which were identical, I must have came across a bug.

My solution worked for the Controller, but not for the keyboard, so this means there must be an issue in the underlying code or somehthing along those lines, so I thought it would be valuable to report my findings and maybe even get answers as to why it doesnt work for keyboard.

I have even made sure to reinstall monogame... I hope to resolve this issue and hope to here from someone soon!

Best whishes.

Sebastian

Hi there,
I updated to MonoGame 3.8.0.1375-develop for `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` and `MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline`. Now during the build I get the following error:

``

The content loader is looking for the content in `bin/Release/netcore3.1/` but the builder packs all into `bin/Windows/`. I can't set platform to `netcore3.1`. So what is the right thing to do here?

Thanks for your great work,
Cheers,
Georg

    <ClosedDate>29/07/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Code>C#
public void SurfaceChanged(ISurfaceHolder holder, global::Android.Graphics.Format format, int width, int height)
{
    // Set flag to recreate gl surface or rendering can be bad on orienation change or if app 
    // is closed in one orientation and re-opened in another.
    lock (_lockObject)
    {
        // can only be triggered when main loop is running, is unsafe to overwrite other states
        if (_internalState == InternalState.Running_GameThread)
        {
            _internalState = InternalState.ForceRecreateSurface;
        }
    }
}

[SurfaceChanged()](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/3fde2bf96888ca7e21dc090389e59260a999401a/MonoGame.Framework/Platform/Android/MonoGameAndroidGameView.cs#L104-L117)

The method is indeed getting called, however the _internalState is still InternalState.Resuming_UIThread . Because of this nothing actually happens and the InternalState is never set to ForceRecreateSurface, which needs to happen.

Because the surface never gets recreated the method [MakeCurrent()](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/3fde2bf96888ca7e21dc090389e59260a999401a/MonoGame.Framework/Platform/Android/MonoGameAndroidGameView.cs#L156-L165) constantly fails and spits out the error 
&gt; eglMakeCurrent:819 error 300b (EGL_BAD_NATIVE_WINDOW)


## Solutions
The way I see it there are 2 possible solutions. 

One would be to implement a system that ensures _internalState will eventually get set to ForceRecreateSurface even if _internalState is not Running_GameThread when SurfaceChanged gets called. I assume this would involve adding some variable such as _needToForceRecreateSurface that __always__ gets set to true in SurfaceChanged and then when _internalState returns to Running_GameThread the state could be set to ForceRecreateSurface by [RunIteration()](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/3fde2bf96888ca7e21dc090389e59260a999401a/MonoGame.Framework/Platform/Android/MonoGameAndroidGameView.cs#L568-L633)

The second solution would be to simply insert the same code from SurfaceChanged into the MakeCurrent method if the failure occurs. Here's an example of that implementation.
C#
public virtual void MakeCurrent()
{
    EnsureUndisposed();
    if (!egl.EglMakeCurrent(eglDisplay, eglSurface,
            eglSurface, eglContext))
    {
        if (egl.EglGetError() == EGL10.EglBadNativeWindow)
        {
            lock (_lockObject)
            {
                // can only be triggered when main loop is running, is unsafe to overwrite other states
                if (_internalState == InternalState.Running_GameThread)
                {
                    _internalState = InternalState.ForceRecreateSurface;
                }
            }
        }
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Error Make Current" + GetErrorAsString());
    }
}
`</Code>

## Issue
So on some Amazon FireTV devices there is an issue resuming from sleep mode. The game resumes however it is only a black screen with music playing. This is currently blocking an update submission of mine. I say _some_ devices because I actually couldn't reproduce the problem at first, I ended up having to do a factory reset on my FireTV Stick 4k to get the problem to show up. So obviously there is something about this that's partially an issue with the device/os itself, however I have found that it is possible to solve the problem on our end.

## Cause
For reference, the issues I'll describe are in this [MonoGameAndroidGameView.cs](

What I've found is that when the FireTV comes out of sleep mode it triggers certain events before monogame is ready. This method must be called __successfully__.
``

I would be glad to implement either of these solutions (or a proposed 3rd option) but wanted to get feedback on the preferred fix before submitting a pull request.

{
    // Make sure the source file is absolute.
    if (!Path.IsPathRooted(sourceFile))
        sourceFile = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), sourceFile);
}


As shown in the snippet above, in the `OnBuild` function, **the full path of the resource is calculated and stored**. Later in the execution, when all the command/configuration has been parsed and the paths full paths have been generated, a loop goes through all the content generating the output files. The same thing happens on the `OnCopy` function.

It makes sense to do it, because if we are building files from different paths, then by the time the actual Build or Copy happens, there is no need to worry about the current directory, as the full paths have been generated in the initial parsing.

The problem comes when referencing an extern assembly by using the `/reference` flag. Contrary to what happens with Build and Copy content, the references full path is never calculated in the parsing phase, so when the times comes to actually load the assemblies, if the place where you are calling mgcb is different from the place where the .mgcb file is, then it won't find the assemblies (unless of course the references path are already a full path).

In this snippet it can be seen that the assembly references are just added as is, and no full path is generated

    Name = "reference",

When using the flag `/reference` with a relative path, if you build the .mgcb file from a different folder than the location it's in, it won't find the assemblies. This doesn't happen with other kind of contents, just with references. I think this is the reason.

``

For the sake of consistency, both content and references should have the same treatment and be able to added as relative paths.

With more MG users popping up lately on the official forum, I feel it would be helpful to have new up-to-date sample projects that they can run and learn from. Up until now, we've been relying on XNA samples, but those are slowly becoming unavailable. Some people learn better from diving into the samples than reading up on documentation. This is also an opportunity to cover more game development-specific concepts that the XNA samples didn't address.

Samples may include:

- Pong
- Simple top-down Sokoban
- A simple game state machine (similar to the XNA sample)
- Generic cross-platform project template: multiple platform-specific projects with shared code (I see this asked about a lot)
- And more

These samples should use open, royalty-free assets if required, with proper attribution, and ideally run on vanilla MonoGame.

Running into an issue with a fresh DesktopGL project using .NET Core 3.1.

Currently on a 3000x2000 display with 200% scaling. This problem occurs regardless of how I run the project - whether it's `dotnet run`, or launching the .exe directly. I did see #7004 and #5784, but am still unable to get this working.

An error occurs when publishing a MonoGame DirectX dotnet core project using the PublishTrimmed flag.

I created a new monogame project using the following command:
`dotnet new mgwindowsdx -o DirectX`

Then published the project with the following command:
`dotnet publish -r win-x86 -c Release -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true`

This results in the following error:

`C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\3.1.300\Sdks\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\targets\Microsoft.NET.ILLink.targets(83,5): error MSB6006: "dotnet.exe" exited with code -1073741819. [C:\Users\Matt\Documents\Code\mgcore\Test\DirectX\DirectX.csproj]`

The same error occurs when the PublishSingleFile flag is removed.

I'm playing with doing some procedural music generation and playback in MonoGame using instrument samples. I have several files with names like `TrumpetF#2.wav`. When I try to load these files in my game, I get a file not found exception, and it has truncated the filename starting from the hash. By that I mean my error message is something like 
{"Could not find file 'C:\\devel\\ProceduralMusic\\examples\\Example.MonoGame\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\Content\\Music\\Samples\\Trumpet\\TrumpetF'."}

I've traced this to the code in the `TitleContainer.NormalizeRelativePath` method - the inclusion of the hash character in a filename causes it and anything after it to be excluded from the value of `uri.LocalPath`.

I think can get around this by URL encoding my filenames, but as that might have complications it'd be nice if I didn't have to.

    <Description>In the following example, why does Update still get called approximately 60 times per second?  I expected `IsFixedTimestep=false` to uncap my framerate, but mostly the values jitter around 60fps.  So then I expected changing `TargetElapsedTime` to push me towards the target value, but that doesn't seem to have an effect.  Why doesn't the Game run as fast as possible when `IsFixedTimestep` is false?

``

Notes: 
**[0-2]** no change for any permutation of commenting out these lines.
**[3]** no change when adding a call to the base Update/Draw methods
**[4]** instantaneous fps is good enough for a quick test

I notice `Update` is called more often with `IsFixedTimestep=true` and a small value for `TargetElapsedTime` but I don't want to force the system towards a target framerate (I just want to not cap it at 60 when possible).

I was debugging a SpriteBatch stuttering issue and on the way through [this thread]( #4202, #4207, and [this comment]( when I decided to get a baseline fps count for an empty project, and that's the above code.

Content only get packed into Apk at the first project build, or clean build then build. When you change some game code and Press F5 and let VS rebuild your project and repack Apk, the resulting Apk would not contain Contents. Then you have to clean the android project and then build it manually. This is kinda annoying on debugging.

Test project: 
For fast testing, android fast deploy mode should be disabled to ensure changing game code and then F5 to run would do Apk repacking and upload it to android device, or you have to unplug your android device and plug it back.

It is almost always the command i'm looking to execute and it is closer to the bottom of the menu than the top.

I would say it belongs as the top menu entry.

The current `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Rectangle` class only provides option for integer values, this limits its usage to rendering and other low precision tasks. Which is fine regarding it's use cases.

What I am proposing is that we have a new `Rectangle&lt;T&gt;` class, so that it can store floats, doubles, etc. This will broaden the usage of the `Rectangle` class so that it can be used in precise calculations, such as physics engines, etc. And in order to keep compatability with the API we create a `Rectangle` class which inherits from `Rectangle&lt;int&gt;`. That way SpriteBatch and other functionalities would not need modification.

``

Or would it be more appropriate to create an interface for Rectangle&lt;T&gt;?</Description>

    <CreatedDate>22/05/2020</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>22/05/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>So.. I'm trying to make use of MonoGame's cross platform capabilities in VS2019, and I've seen a few tutorials about using a Shared Project to share code, and the issues regarding Content management for this.. That's when I saw the "MonoGame Shared Library Project" template.

It's description says it can be used to share code and content between projects, but how do I do that? I mean, even though the project comes with it's own Game1.cs and Content folder, you can't access them from within Visual Studio. You also can't add classes and folders to the project, nor can you add a reference to it from other projects (It doesn't even appear). I've also tried checking the properties and the .shproj file, but nothing seemed to make it work..

So my question is: how do I use it? Is there an issue regarding this template in VS2019, or am I doing it the wrong way? Should I stick to the normal C# shared project for this?

P.S.: I haven't checked if it works with VS2017, but I also don't have enough disk space on C: to install it, so I'd rather avoid this.

When trying to build the project every time, it tries to install the dotnet tool `dotnet-mgcb`, it connects to the configured nuget source which dramatically reduces the build speed if you have a bad network connection to the nuget server.

The following is the log when project starts build:

NOTE I'm use a custom preview version number `3.7.200-develop`(which is actually the MonoGame develop branch). Maybe it's bugged on the version string detection?

    <Description>Hello there,

I've run into what appears to be a caveat of .NET Core.

When not using the audio namespace of MonoGame (e.g. using external sound engine like FMOD), we likely want to allow to remove ``, which is super complex to maintain because .NET Core itself has an absurd amount of dependencies.

I'm having trouble building MonoGame from source and using it in a new .NET Core project. It's not clear to me what I need to do. Here's what I've done:

- Pulled the latest from develop.
- Run `dotnet build` on `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.sln` and `MonoGame.Tools.Linux`.
- Installed the templates with `dotnet new -i Templates` while in the base repo folder.
- Created a new project with `dotnet new mgdesktopgl`.
- Build the project with `dotnet build` and get the following error:
``
It looks like it doesn't have the MG nuget package installed, but I'm not sure how to install and use the one I've built from source. It looks like there's also a similar issue with the pipeline tool. What do I need to do to resolve this?

It does not seem to be possible to use UIImagePickerController to select an image on iOS.

1) The image selection appears and a file can be retrieved, but the display stops responding and will not become active until an orientation change happens.

2) Trying to load the resulting image results in a black box if the image is not square (which I think is because of [this issue]( even trying to resize the image to be square and load it results in garbage being loaded.

This is easy to reproduce using the package [Xam.Plugin.Media]( and calling the following code:
``
and then try loading a texture from the file.Path location.

Before installing that package I tried manually doing this with UIImagePickerController code, with the exact same results as I get from using the Xam.Plugin.Media package.

The image retrieved is fine - I've tried saving it and reloading it on the next run and that all works fine, so some internal graphics stuff are getting corrupted by the looks of things.

This happens on both simulators and an iPhone 4S device.

Not sure if this is expected or not but has been causing some problems in my movement/collision code. Was not an issue in a previous version of Monogame (I believe I was using 3.5 previously).

Anyway when you set  `IsFixedTimeStep=false` and simply set a `Console.WriteLine(gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds);` in update you will see that dragging the window around spikes TotalSeconds (up to 0.5s if you hold the window long enough). This is not the case when  `IsFixedTimeStep=true`.

To replicate just create an empty project (I tried on Windows &amp; Desktop GL empty projects) set `IsFixedTimeStep=false`  in constructor or initialize &amp; log the TotalSeconds &amp; drag the window around.

Hi. 

I'm building a level editor for our game, in which we take advantage of the Update and Draw methods of the Game class, being integrated with Eto.Forms it is not possible to update / draw from the main thread at this moment. 

The thing is that we create 2 windows, and one of them which is the Game window, must be hidden or opacity set to 0, I've seen that the Window has an implementation of a SDL2Window, which led me to conclusion that maybe using reflection we can set the game window to a hidden state. 

It would be nice that the Hide function could be cross-platform so other users can benefit from it.

Because [availableSourcesCollection is a List(int) within OpenALSoundController.cs]( multiple integers of the same value can be added to it.

There are possible instances where ReleaseSource(int sourceId) function can be is called for the same sourceId.

If two sound effect instances end up with the same source id there are invalid operation exceptions within openal leading to sounds not playing, dynamic sound effects looping, and other problems.

There are a few instances where this has occurred in our projects.

**Instance A:**

- When DynamicSoundEffects are disposed [PlatformDispose() and base.Dispose()]( are called.

- [PlatformDispose() releases the source by calling RecycleSource instead of FreeSource so HasSourceId is never set to false](

- base.Dispose() calls [base.PlatformDispose()]( which calls [FreeSource()]( and [releases the source again](

**Solution A:** This should be as easy as using controller.FreeSource() instead of [controller.RecycleSource()]( and adding a conditional check for HasSourceId == true beforehand so it cannot be disposed more than once.

--------------------------------

**Instance B:**
Unfortunately that is not the only case where this can happen. There is also the possibility that GC tries to dispose SoundEffects while SoundEffectInstancePool.Update() is stopping finished sounds. Both of those instances running at the same time result in the available openAl sources list being filled with duplicate ids.

**Solution for B:** Wrap the FreeSource() functions within mutex locks so that we can be sure that the source hasn't been freed and the source isn't currently being freed before finally recycling the source.

--------------------------------

    <Description>I could no longer open the MonoGame content pipeline executable after updating to the most recent development build of MonoGame.

Using Windows 10.

Steps to reproduce:

- Download MonoGame build 3.8.0.1082 installer and installer
- Attempt to open the MonoGame pipeline tool. Blue circle spins for fraction of second and nothing else occurs. Restart doesn't help. Uninstalling and reinstalling MonoGame does not help.
- Download MonoGame 3.7.1 (last official release)
- MonoGame pipeline tool runs properly again

I'm willing to pull extra system details if useful in investigation. Fortunately, anyone can just revert to the last official release to continue working.</Description>

I have integrated MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task into my project in order to have my Content built by MGCB during build. On my german system this throws an exception during build:

`Der Ausdruck ""Paket-ID      Version      Befehle      Manifest".Substring(-1, 15)" kann nicht ausgewertet werden. StartIndex darf nicht kleiner als Null sein.` referencing the file `C:\Users\matth\.nuget\packages\monogame.content.builder.task\3.8.0.1179-develop\build\MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task.targets`

Diving into the targets file I discovered that the output of `dotnet tool list -local` is parsed to discover the installed version of MGCB. The problem here is that the parsing depends on the english column names `Package Id`, `Version`, `Commands` and `Manifest`while the columns are named `Paket-ID`, `Version`, `Befehle` and `Manifest` on my german system.

I tried to mitigate the problem by changing the culture for the current thread, but that does not effect the command's output.

Instead of depending on the exact string one could instead use the column position, for e.g. change

``

That will make the parsing language agnostic. Just tested it ok on my german system.

False test failure on windows test for a pull request to remove redundancys in measure string.
I believe.  Pull request was made in relation to 


Can someone take a look at this.  





I got a failing test for a pull request that actually makes no difference to the return result of a measure string. As measure string has no knowledge of a SpriteEffect and simply returns the same result either way a size, that should be positive.


Measure string is accounting for cropping that spritebatch doesn't in either of its overloads so that will cause a visual drawing to returned size error if it can ever even happen in reality. Im not sure its just not totally redundant anyways.

`Vector2 size = spriteFont.MeasureString(testText); `

// Doesn't have a clue ^^^ if SpriteEffect.Vertical or Horizontal is intended.

Im guessing this is because a test is using measure string for drawstring but i have no idea how to find that test and check it. Unless those useless lines were added to measure string for the test meh.
If that is the case then spritebatch needs to account for those lines as well.

Or is there something else that is failing i don't see not very good with github.

I am experiencing slight issues with the current CSharp Templates from NuGet in Visual Studio (2019). I have installed the current templates (MonoGame.Templates.CSharp:3.8.0.1176-develop)
  - via `dotnet new MonoGame.Templates.CSharp:3.8.0.1176-develop` as well as
  - via the Visual Studio Extension `MonoGame project templates` Version 1.0.0.

The templates get installed without issues and even show up in the Visual Studio New Project Wizard if they are installed via the Visual Studio Extension.

If I than create a new project from the template `MonoGame Windows Desktop Application (Windows DirectX)' there are two NuGet packages listed in the project:
  - MonoGame.Content.Builder (3.8.*)
  - MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX (3.8.*)

These packages can not be restored by Visual Studio. A couple of problems occur here:
- The Monogame NuGet feed ( lists V3.8.0.1103 as the latest stable version but this version does not seem to be available for download. (Visual Studio will only use the latest stable version if you reference packages with wildcards.)
- The public NuGet Repository only has MonoGame 3.7.* packages available.
- The package `MonoGame.Content.Builder` is not listed at all.
- Updating the package `Monogame.Framework.WindowsDX` in Visual Studio to the latest preview build (3.8.0.1176-develop) does not work because it complains that the listed latest stable build (3.8.0.1103) is not available.
- Uninstalling the package `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` in Visual Studio does not work because it complains that the listed latest stable build (3.8.0.1103) is not available.

To resolve this issue you will have to manually remove the packages from the Solution Explorer and than install the latest preview build of `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` via NuGet Package Manager.

How to install `MonoGame.Content.Builder` I have no clue. Is that necessary at all?

I'm cross-compiling my game built in Windows with .NET Framework 4.7.2 to macOS using `mkbundle` with the mono 5.18.0 runtime for macOS 10.9 (64-bit). When double-clicking to run the game, the paths do not point to the actual executable, which is in `home/Desktop/Folder`:

- `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` reports the home folder
- `typeof(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Color).Assembly.Location` - reports the home folder

This prevents the game from loading native libraries [such as SDL]( and [loading content]( because MonoGame internally uses these properties. Things work fine on Windows and Linux and if I run the game through the terminal. This prevents me from making an app bundle.

My current workaround for native library loading is to set `Environment.CurrentDirectory` to the application directory, which is retrieved through the native `proc_pidpath` function on macOS using the id of the current process. However, all content fails to load because it's still looking in the wrong location. I've tried later Mono runtimes and they still fail.

I've searched far and wide, and I can't find much about this issue. One option is to default to these paths and allow the developer to change them.

On Mac OS X Catalina, the call to SDL_Init() triggers a Keystroke Receiving popup - the app "would like to receive keystrokes from any application":

![image](

This causes rejection in the Mac App Store review process:

&gt; Guideline 2.4.5(v) - Performance
&gt; Your app requests admin access from the user during operation.

and after requesting more info from the Apple reviewer:

&gt; To resolve this issue, it would be appropriate to confirm that you are using:
&gt; - NSEvent.addLocalMonitor
&gt; rather than
&gt; - CGEvent.TapCreate.
&gt;
&gt; In addition, it would be appropriate to remove
&gt; IOHIDCheckAccess(kIOHIDRequestTypeListenEvent) for accessing the user’s keystroke under
&gt; Privacy, as apps with this feature are not appropriate for the App Store.

The popup appears within the call to SDL_Init() in the SdlGamePlatform constructor in SdlGamePlatform.cs:

``

If one passes 0 to the Sdl.Init() call instead of the flags above, the popup does not appear, but instead it appears later on in the creation of SdlGameWindow in  the call to SDL_CreateWindow(), so I cannot see anyway around this.

Also, calling Sdl.Init(0) followed by Sdl.InitSubSystem((int)Sdl.InitFlags.Video), the popup is indeed called during the SDL video subsystem initialisation. (Note: Sdl.InitSubSystem() is not present in MonoGame - I added it locally for testing).

    <Title>Is it possible to instance a very large group of vectors or matrices?</Title>
    <CreatedDate>25/03/2020</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>25/03/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>So im thinking about how to instance a bunch of geometry for a model. 
But its not just geometry and instance data but animation information in addition that im thinking of.

The thing is to really make it work i would need to put the animation data quaternions positions and scale vectors on the shader then create the bone matrices on it. There would be a lot of them or could be a lot of them per model some models have over 1000 keys per animation. 
Now if i could put them on the shader i might be able to just do the calculations per bone on the shader per instance based on animation time. But im not sure about the data limitations and this on the cpu is precalculated so im not sure its possible to upload these form the matrices and then use them for each instance of the geometry on the gpu.

I really have no clue how to even approach this yet but im thinking about the bone matrix limit that xna had placed on matrices and im wondering how realistic this thought is as the way im doing it now is just uploading the bones per mesh to the shader but the bone animations are calculated cpu side.

Since im in the dark on how to approach this or if its even possible? 
Any information or thoughts would be welcome.
More so if anyone has experience doing something similar already.

I have a library that reference the netstandard package `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.Core`, then i reference my library in a WindowsDX core monogame project.

it just raises `Could not load file or assembly 'MonoGame.Framework, Version=3.8.0.12, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference.`

Then i tried with the old version `3.8.0.2` and it works fine.

It seems version `3.8.0.12` of `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.Core`  make `PrivateAssets=All` used in `PackageReference`  effectless.

When drawing a simple rectangle of (0, 0, 100, 100) with `GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives`, in version MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.Core **3.7.0.7**, it works without any problem, but in version 3.8.0.2, the left border of the rectangle doest not show up, it seems off-screen.

#### How to reproduce

1. Run the shape demo provided by MonoGame.Extended project

2. Draw a rectangle like ` _primitiveDrawing.DrawRectangle(new Vector2(0, 0), 100, 100, Color.Yellow);`
3. Run the demo you'll see no problem, since the default MonoGame package referenced by the demo is 3.7.0.7
4. Upgrade demo reference of MonoGame to 3.8.0.2
5. You'll get the problem.

Hi,
I've recently updated to MonoGame 3.8.0.1082 and now the Pipeline Tool is not opening anymore. I tried to run it from a cmd to see if there was any error message. I managed to get this one: 
System.InvalidOperationException: Platform not found. Are you missing the platform assembly?
▒ Eto.Platform.Get(String platformType, Boolean allowNull)
▒ Eto.Forms.Application..ctor(String platformType)
▒ MonoGame.Tools.Pipeline.Program.Main(String[] args)

I rolled back to another version of MonoGame and no problem. So the problem is definitely linked to that version.

    <Title>Content Pipeline support for arbitrary text config files (including JSON, YAML, etc.)</Title>
    <CreatedDate>04/03/2020</CreatedDate>

    <Code>csharp
string json = content.Load&lt;string&gt;("path/to/some/config.json")
JObject config = Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(json);


This would be implemented as a straightforward `ContentImporter` that reads the input file and returns a `string` result, defaulting to the `PassThroughProcessor`, since it's expected that the user will do their own processing within their game logic.

# Alternatives

One obvious alternative would be to simply read the file directly, with `System.IO.File.ReadAllText()` or a similar API. My assumption is that a lot of people would rather keep all their content files &amp; content-loading code in one place within the MonoGame framework. Providing them an easy way to load arbitrary config files would lead to simpler &amp; more-orthogonal business logic.

Another alternative would be for each developer to implement their own custom content importer, for example [as described in this blog post](http://blog.dylanwilson.net/posts/2015/creating-custom-content-importers-for-the-monogame-pipeline/). Unfortunately, that's a bit of an laborious process if all you want to do is load a couple simple text files and parse them from within your game. 

MonoGame.Extended includes [JSON support](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/tree/develop/Source/MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline/Json), but including all of MonoGame.Extended feels like a lot just to load some JSON files -- and it only supports JSON specifically, not any other text-file formats that someone might want to use. It's also described in the code as "very nearly fully working", which does not instill confidence.

Finally, there's the approach I've actually taken in my game for now: include a JSON string inside an XML file and use XmlImporter, like so:
xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;XnaContent&gt;
  &lt;Asset Type="System.String"&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[
JSON goes here
]]&gt;
  &lt;/Asset&gt;
&lt;/XnaContent&gt;
`</Code>
    <Description>This is a feature request / design review for functionality that I'm happy to implement &amp; contribute as long as the MonoGame devs approve of the concept. Comments / suggestions welcome!

# Proposal

Right now, the MonoGame content pipeline has the ability to import XML files via `XmlImporter`, but many folks would rather keep metadata &amp; config files in a different format, such as JSON, Windows INI / .cfg files, YAML, etc.

Rather than implementing separate processors for every possible plain-text file format, I propose adding a generic `TextImporter` to the content pipeline, which simply reads the associated file and presents it to the user as a C# string. The user can then parse it with their favorite JSON / YAML (etc) parser; for example:

``
This *works*, but I'm not proud of it. It feels slightly cursed.

# Questions

* How do we handle the encoding of the input text files? My preference would be to only support UTF-8 files, or perhaps to make two separate importers `Utf8Importer` and `Utf16Importer` for the two most-common Unicode formats.

# Expected limitations

* We will not handle legacy non-Unicode file encodings such as Windows code pages, Shift-JIS, and so on.

* The text file will be loaded into a single string in memory. A user who wants to load a file that's too big to fit in memory should probably implement their own streaming loading system instead of trying to use the proposed `TextImporter`.</Description>

MonoGame crashes during initialization on an iPad 3 physical device running iOS 9.

The current MonoGame initialization code incorrectly assumes that GLES 3 is available on a device if the iOS version number is 7 or higher.

In fact, some devices such as the iPad 3 do not support GLES 3, but they do support iOS versions up to 9.

The proposed fix is to first attempt to initialize GLES 3, and if that fails, fall back to GLES 2, per the [Apple developer documentation]( (see Listing 2-1).

I am trying to make an OpenGL project but when I run it, it tells me that it requires either ARB_framebuffer_object or EXT_framebuffer_object (both of which my system *seems* to have) and suggests that I update my drivers, when I try to though, the installer tells me that my system doesn't meet the minimum requirements to install the software.

Does monogame draw models completely differently than XNA? 

As a learning exercise I am trying to convert this XNA chess game to monogame: 

You can just copy their game class in a monogame project and it'll compile - only thing I had to change was :
``

The issue I am having is everything is displayed wrong, I am using the exact same code, literal copy and paste - see screenshots:

[XNA](

[Monogame](

The only other thing I had to do was - when I added the model FBX files, the pipeline tool failed with:
`Imported FbxImporter had unexpected failure!
Error importing file: FBX-DOM unsupported, old format version, supported are only FBX 2011, FBX 2012 and FBX 2013`

I opened the file in visual studio 2017, and did save as FBX, and that made the models compile. That wouldn't affect how they would get drawn, would it?

UWP project isn't starting up properly because the SharpDX assemblies are not included within C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoGame\v3.0\Assemblies\WindowsUniversal.

It was fine with the 3.7.1 release. I managed to fix it by copying the SharpDX assemblies from the Windows Directory to the WindowsUniversal directory and rebuilding the UWP project.

    <Description>I think it would be nice to have a list of samples in the readme to make it easy for people to find examples of monogame apps.  Maybe it could look something like this?

## Monogame Samples &amp; Demos
You can find monogame samples at the following locations
- [Official Monogame Samples](
- [Monogame.Extended Samples](
- [CartBlanche's Samples](

### Bonus

It would also be nice to add screenshots for each of the samples/demos so people can see what they are.

### Thoughts?

I think it's important to have samples for new comers.  Maybe this would be good to have on the website as well?  Are there other collection of samples that I missed?  Overall, I want to make it easier for people to start using monogame.

If you all are okay with this, I'd be happy to make a pull request to add this.</Description>

GraphicsDevice.PlatformClear and GraphicsDevice.PlatformPresent are public when targeting OpenGL or Web but private when targeting DirectX. This can lead to errors when switching platforms or potentially cause a System.MethodAccessException when using assemblies built for a different platform.

The [documentation for SDL_GameControllerMapping]( explicitly states that the returned string must be freed with SDL_free(). [MonoGame's implementation]( gets gamepad mappings and converts the native strings to .NET strings, but the associated `IntPtr` is never freed. This happens every time [PlatformGetCapabilities is called]( on a connected gamepad.

A simple fix would be to pass the IntPtr into SDL_free in GetMapping right after obtaining the .NET string but before returning it.

When loading libraries such as SDL on macOS, MonoGame looks in the directory of the Microsoft.Xna.Framework assembly. This means the .dylib files must be in the same folder as the .DLL files (or executable if using mkbundle) for MonoGame to load them, but this shouldn't be relied on for .app bundles.

According to the [official documentation]( the SDL and OpenAL dylibs would be better suited in the "Frameworks" folder of an app bundle so the game uses the packaged version of the dylibs instead of a shared version that may be installed. Loading the libraries in the same folder as the assembly may work now, but there's no telling if this will change in future versions of macOS .app bundles, not to mention certification for the App Store.

The [OpenAL]( and [SDL]( library loaders can be changed to look for the files in "../Frameworks/" first if the platform is OSX then default to the current directory if not found, or vice versa. Basically, something similar to what [TitleContainer already does](

    <Description>We have had some issues reported to us recently regarding our clients game on the Amazon App Store.  It seems this issue has started occurring fairly recently and they all report they are on a Kindle Fire HD 10 tablet (Gen 8+,  doesn't occur on our Fire HD 10 Gen 7).  

We only have fairly vague bug reports from customers, but largely they seem to say it wont launch at all.  And one or two report it either won't install, or will crash part way through loading. 

It's a paid app so people are raging pretty hard and requesting refunds.  We have a couple of these tablets on their way so hopefully we can reproduce on a device when it arrives. 

In the meantime Amazon have supplied a log of the crash.  Trawling through it I don't see a much apart from OpenAL failing to initialise.  Relevant part of logs below:

``

Does this seem something likely to cause the app to fail launching?  After OpenAL fails to initialise the next part of the logs shows some audio getting loaded.  I'd have to double check but from what I remember audio is the first thing we load. 

Any help would be much appreciated, got a pretty unhappy client on our hands :)

This is not about MG itself but a core component that allows MG to run on consoles - [BRUTE]( Aside from the console-specific bits, is there a reason it's not widely available and open? There's a lack of quality open-source IL to C++ transpilers, and I'd imagine this would create a lot of new opportunities regarding .NET game development, including on desktop, mobile, and especially web platforms.

Currently available .NET AOT options (feel free to enlighten me):
- **.NET Native** - specific to Windows/UWP.
- **CoreRT** - in a preview state and may or may not ever fully develop, as good as it currently is.
- **Unity IL2CPP** - locked down and deeply tied to their proprietary engine.

Based on BRUTE's website, BRUTE sounds like an ideal tool to have an open community of collaborators and users. We know how well it works on consoles due to all the MG games developed for them. I'd love to have a discussion about this and learn more since I don't have access to the tool.

Contents are not packed correctly in iOS. 
Given a png assets file `joystick-background.png`, it should generate a file `joystick-background.xnb` on game build. But when you run the game in iPhone with a debugger, it just raises content load exception with message `The content file was not found.`

According to the Monogame documentation on monogame.net, the KeyboardState structure should have the GetPressedKeyCount method. However, when I tried to use it in my program, it said that "KeyboardState does not contain a definition" for that method. I then looked at the KeyboardState definition in the metadata and it doesn't contain a definition for GetPressedKeyCount.

The offset is incorrectly subtracted from length when building a sound effect.



code should be:

        private static DataStream ToDataStream(int offset, byte[] buffer, int length)
        {
            var data = new byte[length];
            Buffer.BlockCopy(buffer, offset, data, 0, length);

Hello.  there is such a beautiful thing as AvaloniaUI.  This is a UI for all platforms.  you need to add support for this framework.  It is necessary to implement some interfaces and provide access to the window for AvaloniaUI.  I think it will not be difficult for you to do this, because you know the whole architecture of the project.  Need a function that will provide a DataClass for AvaloniaUI so that it can work.  In the code, the person himself will decide whether to connect it from the outside or not.  Well, the interfaces can be sent by AvaloniaUI in PR themselves.  This issue   And git repo

in TextureCollection.OpenGL.cs PlatformSetTextures

the range used with GL.ActiveTexture(TextureUnit.Texture0 + i) is bound by MaxTextureSlots value.

However the documentation of GL.ActiveTexture() says the limit is GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS -1

which in my test setup (Ubuntu 18.04 in virtualbox) is reporting 8 instead of 32 for MaxTextureImageUnits which is causing glerror 1282

The correct nuget package should be `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.Core`, but the template
instead points to `MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL.Core`.  This causes projects created from the template to fail upon using `dotnet restore`.

Additionally, the version of `MonoGame.Content.Builder` it references doesn't exist on nuget.  The latest version on nuget is `3.7.0.9`, whereas the template references `3.8.*`.

    <Description>Hey there!

We're currently porting our game to UWP and I noticed that vibrations on a Xbox One controller make the triggers to vibrate instead of the handles (Xbox One controllers have 4 different vibration actuators: 2 in handles, 2 in triggers).

For consistency, vibration should be applied to handles and not to triggers.

I haven't checked if this affects the standard DirectX target.

Cheers!

MonoGame crashed with `GL.GetError() returned 1286` in iOS when building the iOSCore.csproj with debug mode, like: `./build.sh --build-target=BuildiOS --build-configuration=Debug`. But release mode is fine.
GL error 1286 should be `Invalid framebuffer operation`.

The DopplerPitchScalar variable of a cue instance is not used at all. See the /MonoGame/MonoGame.Framework/Audio/Xact/Cue.cs#Apply3D
I'm sure its not optimized mathematically, but here is my implementation

                // Calculate doppler effect.
                var distancePlusVelocity = ((listener.Position + listener.Velocity) - (emitter.Position + emitter.Velocity)).Length();
                var relativeVelocity = (distance - distancePlusVelocity) * emitter.DopplerScale; // negative if moving away, positive if gets closer
                var dopplerPitchScalar = (1f + relativeVelocity / SoundEffect.SpeedOfSound) / (1f - relativeVelocity / SoundEffect.SpeedOfSound);
                var d = FindVariable("DopplerPitchScalar");
                _variables[d].SetValue(dopplerPitchScalar);

I was going to use the Doppler effect of moving sounds in my game using cues, after spending half a day, checked the code. Its just not implemented (!)
``
So what is going on here

1. We have a distance between listener and emitter now in relative units, say meters.
2. We calculate distance between them in next second, after velocity was applied.
3. So we get relative velocity in meters per second by (1st - 2nd distance).
4. This relative velocity is actually used as V in the Doppler equation 
![Doppler equation](

, where C is the speed of sound in environment, W0 is original frequency and W is final frequency. I was implemented it by Russian Wiki ( seems there is the same formula in English Wiki, but looking different.
5. This multiplier of W0 and the DopplerPitchScalar variable for XACT are the same
![XACT RPC]( just found it empirically, and it worked, but can't be fully sure.
Can you guys implement it correctly ?
Thanks !

    <Title>Pipeline dotnet tool</Title>
    <CreatedDate>29/10/2019</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>11/04/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I don't believe there's been much discussion of the design of the Pipeline dotnet global tool. I'm interested in helping with that next, as I think that's the last piece that need to be nugetized.

### Open Questions

1. **Future of Pipeline tool.** **[EDIT] Resolved:** Pipeline is here to stay, while cra0zy is working on his own alternative.

    &gt; @Jjagg I am in process of writing something custom for the content builder, among the other stuff, so I'm leaving this to you. I really don't wanna touch MGCB/Pipeline Tool anymore.

    _Originally posted by @cra0zy in 

    Should we be expecting something to replace the current tooling, or is that just personal preference or maybe an alternative option? (I assume the latter)

2. **Name.** **[EDIT] Resolved:** MGCB Editor is currently the top contender, with commands like `dotnet tool run mgcb-editor`

    As a public package, "Pipeline" is too generic. What name should be used for the package and the command? (Note: our other tools are `dotnet-mgcb` and `dotnet-2mgfx`.) For example:
    - Tool: `dotnet-mgpipeline`
    - Global command: `mgpipeline`
    - Local command: `dotnet tool run mgpipeline`

3. **Structure.** **[EDIT] Resolved:** The platform packages can't be unified, because we want native UI controls on Windows. We can, however, package them together and have a cross-platform launcher so the experience is seamless across all platforms.

    Should we package platform-specific Pipeline tools, or unify them? Is UI the only thing preventing these from being unified? Presumably shaders can just continue to not compile on non-Windows for now.
    - Platform-specific would be easiest since it would keep the same structure and Eto dependencies. We can publish `dotnet-mgpipeline-windows`, `dotnet-mgpipeline-mac`, `dotnet-mgpipeline-linux`, but this is clearly not ideal.
    - We can switch to a new cross-platform .NET Core UI framework and publish a single cross-platform tool. The most popular appears to be [Avalonia](
    - We can use MonoGame.DesktopGL itself for the UI -- either a 3rd party UI framework, or maintain an _extremely_ slim set of controls just for the tools (not a part of the MG framework).

4. **MGCB dependency.** **[EDIT] Resolved:** MGCB will be packaged directly into MGCB Editor. The duplicated files aren't too large and shouldn't be much concern for devs.

    How should the MGCB dependency be handled?
    - Just package MGCB binaries into the Pipeline tool as well? Then users who use the Pipeline tool and build with the MonoGame.Content.Builder package (#6905) would have a handful of files duplicated, but it's not a big issue. Is there a concern about the two versions needing to be manually kept in sync?
    - Package MGCB binaries into the Pipeline tool, but don't additionally required the MGCB tool when using the Pipeline tool. Instead use MGCB out of the Pipeline tool. See the _Usage_ option below for more details.
    - Have the Pipeline tool depend on the MGCB dotnet tool. This would be difficult, because if the Pipeline tool is installed globally, then it would have to also install the MGCB tool globally, which is an option we decided to avoid with MonoGame.Content.Builder. This could also be difficult to run locally out of the MonoGame repo, because the Pipeline tool would need to be able to either depend on the MGCB dotnet tool or use the local MGCB project.

5. **Usage.** **[EDIT] Resolved:** /register and /unregister CLI commands will be available to associate the app with the .mgcb extension by running `pipeline /register` (global) or `dotnet tool run pipeline /register` (local).

    I expect a common scenario to be installing as a global tool, but can we enable more options?
    - As an additional option, I was thinking about being able to specify an option in the MonoGame.Content.Builder package (#6905) to restore the Pipeline tool instead of MGCB. This would make it easier for content designers to just clone a repo and automatically get the recommended tooling. And obviously this wouldn't have to compromise any of the core MonoGame.Content.Builder functionality.
    - Will we need to give up associating the `.mgcb` file extension with the tool? This doesn't seem like a good option anymore since dotnet tools can be installed globally or locally. Following the potential usage option above, in my own repos I plan to change my Pipeline extensions project into a netcoreapp that can simply call `dotnet tool run pipeline` on the correct `.mgcb` file.</Description>

I built the WindowsDX nuget package from the develop branch.
When I run a game, I get this error when MonoGame.Framework.dll tries to load SharpDX:
``

When I look inside the nuget package (both from cake's `build.ps1` and `dotnet pack`), the SharpDX DLLs are indeed missing. They're present in the MonoGame.Framework WindowsDX build output, but don't get pulled into the nuget, presumably because of the type of `Reference`. Do we still need the local DLLs instead of using `PackageReference`s like WindowsUniversal does? If so, we need to fix this by packing them into the nupkg, right?

    <Description>This is a question about the design and usage of the recent dotnet tools: 2MGFX and MGCB. I haven't found much discussion of this, but please point me in the right direction if I missed a thread. Apologies for the verbosity.

#### Question

Do we expect users to manually install dotnet tools before being able to build their game, or should they get the functionality automatically from the template or a PackageReference?

I'm under the impression that MonoGame is moving toward a model where a dev can clone a game repo and build without requiring any manual installation.

#### Problem

Dotnet tools seem to be intended more as manual helpers, rather than for use in automated build steps, for the following reasons:

1. Dotnet tools are not automatically restored on build. `dotnet restore` is run on build, but still not `dotnet tool restore`. This means tools need to be manually and explicitly installed or restored.
2. Dotnet tools cannot be transitive dependencies, by design, as opposed to package references.  You won't be able to reference a MonoGame.Content.Builder package that in turn references the MGCB tool. This means that any project intending to use MGCB will either need the tool installed globally, or listed in a manifest for local tool restore.

#### Solutions

Given those constraints, I see the following options:

1. Publish a MonoGame.Content.Builder package that expects the MGCB tool to be present.
    - The user can then choose to install the tool globally, or check in a local tool manifest and manually restore from it.
    - **Concern:** The user must manually install or restore the tool.
2. Publish a MonoGame.Content.Builder package that depends on the MGCB tool, but automatically runs `dotnet tool restore`.
    - The user can still choose to install the tool globally or check in a local tool manifest. In the case of a local manifest, though, it will be automatically restored as part of build. I'm not sure if this has perf implications or why it's not already automatic.
    - **Concern:** The repo must contain a local manifest, or the user must manually install the tool.
3. Keep MonoGame.Content.Builder as is.
    - The package has full control over the MGCB dependency, requiring no manual action.
    - **Concern:** This is somewhat non-standard and doesn't use the dotnet tools at all.</Description>

    <Description># Problem
As today, the available "dotnet" templates create platform specific projects.

# What we want
As a developer, I considered that it would be quite handy to have a template that creates a solution with the appropriate projects for each supported platform and a special project that should hold all the shared code (either a .NET Standard Library or a Shared Library, whatever it fits better).

Also, it the Content files (.mgcb) should be shared among the projects. Is this possible already?</Description>

    <Description>Hello, I'm just making a normal game (.NET Core 3.0) and everything works fine on the debug and release build. However, when I publish the project as a single executable (trimmed) and copy the Content folder I get this exception:
``
I'm pretty sure there's nothing wrong with .NET Core 3.0 or single file executables because nothing was thrown when I loaded textures. I can confirm the exception is thrown when loading the font because not loading it works just fine. I've tried cleaning and rebuilding, copying the Content folder from all other directories, but it still throws the error when it loads the font.

The `.spritefont` file is the default. I didn't change anything, it's just Arial. And like I said, it loads and renders fine when debugging.

    <Description>Hey there!

Many efforts have been started to future-proof MonoGame and make it a modern .Net framework but it seems that there is no comprehensive centralized point where to understand how things should move forward and their current state.

Hence, I'm trying to maintain this issue to keep track of the different tasks. Please feel free to point me to any untracked tasks or progress.

I guess that we will agree on the following main objective: **making MonoGame fully .Net Standard 2.0 compliant in its entirety** (all targets, all of its tools, and its build/test/package process), while maintaining a backward compatibility where it's relevant.

This would mean: being able to consume MonoGame as a `` once protobuild is gone)

**Bonus stage for console targets (which unfortunately can't be discussed publicly):**
- [x] ~Keeping VS2015 and net45 non-SDK style projects while being compatible with the parent repository structure~ (deprecated)
- [x] Refactoring MGCB and Pipeline to find console targets 
- [x] Enforce C# 5.0 language version </Description>

    <Description>Integrating MonoGame with WPF creates a pretty nice environment for building tools and editors.
 
However, as C# 8 is only available with .NET Core (and Standard 2.1) this causes a bit of an issue. 

WPF is now fully supported by .NET Core 3.0. 

It would be really nice with a build for .NET Core or Standard for use in a .NET Core 3.0 WPF application.</Description>

After about 250.000 iterations of the loop the size of my heap has not increased but the used memory (private bytes) for my process has reached around 1 GB. More iterations inevitable lead to an OutOfMemory (System.OutOfMemoryException) situation due to reaching the 2GB barrier for 32Bit processes.

If I increase the vertexCount for the creatio of the Buffer I am able to produce an SharpDXException referencing ApiCode "E_OUTOFMEMORY" before running into the System.OutOfMemoryException.

If I reset the GraphicsDevice all "leaked" memory is reclaimed:

    <Description>The MG installer is causing a high maintenance burden and there are a lot of issues with it. We really don't need to have it anymore if we provide alternatives. That means

- Publish development nugets to a feed. They're published to the TeamCity feed, but IMO we should move to GitHub package feed or MyGet so the publishing of the packages can be done in the CAKE script and finally upgrade from nuget v1. We should also better promote the feed.
- Distribute templates with VSIX and as dotnet new template packages (on the aforementioned nuget feed).
- Distribute CLI tools as dotnet global tools.
- Distribute the Pipeline Tool in some way. Need some discussion for this one, I'm not sure how we best go about this. The Pipeline Tool can use MGCB as a dotnet global tool and will not be tied to any version. We will be able to version it separately. We should make MGCB version configurable in the Pipeline Tool.

I've been reading about the new Cake build scripting being adopted by monogame to replace Protogame...

Reading the code I've noticed there's tricks and hacks to determine which is the current version of MSBuild to use, specially when running concurrently with Visual Studio.

I've had a similar issue recently, and I'm not the only one, so Microsoft has recently released this new nuget package: [Microsoft.Build.Locator](

This package is intended to be used for exactly that purpose; it identifies which is the appropiate MSBuild instance to use in your project, so you don't need to worry about which version is installed, or looking into different directories, that package does it four you.

Usage example can be located [here]( 

I've dropped this here in case it can be useful... close the issue at will 😄

I tried building stable and dev builds of monogame myself and then finding the app crashes on Android versions 6 &amp; 7 when it tries to load dlls. 

I then tried using the dev builds from nuget and they are showing similar behaviour.

It appears to be fine on other versions of Android as do the stable nuget builds of monogame.

I'm using the latest stable Xamarin and Visual Studio Mac versions.

Is it possible that the new version of Xamarin.Android is causing this?

I'm trying to implement music in my game using the MediaPlayer and Song classes, but I'm running into an issue. The first Song I play will play at the desired volume, no matter how many times I play it. However, as soon as I try playing a different Song, the volume is significantly reduced, even though MediaPlayer.Volume is still set to 1. Even if I try switching back to the original Song, the volume is usually reduced as well. Sometimes the first song will still be at the desired volume after switching back to it, but this seems to occur at random and the volume reduction will eventually occur after calling play on it a few more times. The volume reduction seems to be permanent until I close out and start the game again. 

I have tried both MP3 and WAV files, but both run into this issue. This issue does not affect the volume of SoundEffect objects, just Song objects. I tried posting to the forums for a solution, but I was told that this is probably an issue with MonoGame itself and that I should post about it here.

After some experimenting, I found that the problem seems to be related to the ContentManager. Removing all SoundEffect loads from my code fixes the issue, but loading even a single SoundEffect using the ContentManager causes the issue to occur. I'm loading my SoundEffect objects from MP3 files if that's important. 

However, this issue occurred even before adding SoundEffect objects to my project, so I'm not sure why removing them now solved the issue. Anyway, SoundEffect objects may or may not be the only source of the issue, but loading SoundEffect objects is the only consistent way of reproducing the issue that I've found.

Here's a simple example where the issue occurs. I've added the following code to a default Windows project. Pressing A or S will cause the song to play at full volume, but then pressing the other button will cause the other song to play at a reduced volume:

Checking the code, I noticed that `DrawableGameComponent` implements `LoadContent` and `UnloadContent` virtual methods.

- `LoadContent` is called from Initialize();
- `UnloadContent` is not called from anywhere, never.

I think that, at the very least, `DrawableGameComponent` should overload `GameComponent.Dispose(bool disposing)` and call `UnloadContent`.

Currently `PipelineController` upon `DoBuild` tries to set `encoding` within a `try/catch` clause. The clause only catches `NotSupportedException` and initializes `encoding` with `UTF8` in case of the exception.


According to msdn `Encoding.GetEncoding` may also throw `ArgumentException` which means that provided `codepage` is not supported too. Not catching this exception leads to the pipeline tool sometimes being unresponsive on build/rebuild/clean actions:

[`Joystick.GetState`]( allocates new arrays for each `JoystickState`, which can lead to lots of garbage over time considering input is usually obtained multiple times a frame for controllers. I can think of a few options for improving this:
* Add a cached default state that is simply returned when we need to return a [default JoystickState]( This avoids allocating multiple zero-length arrays.
* Add some type of garbage-less overload that takes in user-defined arrays to fill the information with. The user can get the `JoystickCapabilities` first to see how many axes, buttons, and hats the joystick has - the existing code already does this, as a matter of fact. One thing to consider would be how to cleanly present this API.

    <Description>This is a proposal to simplify publishing for DesktopGL.When building a DesktopGL game, dependencies for Mac, Linux and Windows are included. It would be nice to have MSBuild properties that users can set to remove native dependencies except for the target platform. E.g. the following properties: `MGTargetWin64`, `MGTargetWin32`, `MGTargetMac`, `MGTargetLinux64`, `MGTargetLinux32`, `MGTargetWin` and `MGTargetLinux` (last two to include both 32- and 64-bit).When publishing with dotnet CLI we can check the RID (runtime identifier, e.g. win-x64) to figure out what dependencies are necessary.  cc @cra0zy @mrhelmut </Description>

[DllImport ("libc")]
static extern int uname(IntPtr buf);

The call to uname was causing a dll not found crash. The full path needs to be specified for Macs to cover this problem.

Note I could not reproduce this problem but many of my customers could. I believe its connected to the fact that you have to do a hardened codesign and codesign the individual dylib libraries also in the MonoBundle part of the application.

I used the following to fix the code and keep it working for Linux also.
Replace the DllImport call with:

[DllImport ("libc", EntryPoint="uname")]
static extern int unameNoPath(IntPtr buf);
[DllImport ("/usr/lib/libc", EntryPoint="uname")]
static extern int unameWithPath(IntPtr buf);

and the uname() call with:

int unameResult;
try {
   unameResult = unameNoPath (buf);
} catch {
   unameResult = unameWithPath (buf);
}
if (unameResult == 0) {



There is also a bug in the file just after the uname() call - the return needs to be removed after the line 

os = OS.MacOSX;

and instead add a check before the switch break:

if (os == OS.MacOSX)
   break;

os = OS.Linux;
break;

After going through the convoluted process of getting an app notarised so it can run on Mac OS X 10.15 Catalina, a problem popped up for some people:

&gt; System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Keyboard' threw an exception. ---&gt; System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Sdl' threw an exception. ---&gt; System.DllNotFoundException: libdl.so.2 at (wrapper managed-to-native) MonoGame.Utilities.FuncLoader+Linux.dlopen(string,int)

As you can see "Linux.dlopen" was being called and not the Mac function.

Lots of delving later I discovered the problem to be in CurrentPlatform.cs, in the DLLImport call for uname:

    <Description>It seems that any looping SoundEffectInstances that have been paused at any point, after being stopped, will never be cleared from the list availableSourcesCollection in OpenALSoundController.cs , causing a InstancePlayLimitException after some time.  I managed to reduce it down to a test case, if you comment out the pausing it will no longer crash.  This means we are unable to pause sound effect instances.

XNA 3.0 had two transparent values,  TransparentBlack &amp; TransparentWhite. When XNA 4.0 switch to use premultiplied colors by default, they drop both properties and replaced them with Color.Transparent. 

MG still defines Color.TransparentBlack which has the same value as Color.Transparent. 
I propose to mark TransparentBlack as 'Obsolete' for now and then remove it on a later version.

The out-of-the-box default MonoGame Android app - which just gives you a cornflower blue screen - cannot be resumed after exiting it with the back arrow. It just flashes for an instant and exits immediately. The app has to be manually killed and then cold started to make it work - but resuming doesn't work.

Every time I try to resume the app, this is what's logged to the debug output:

    <Description>Is there any reason ( other than the bug patch here:  ) because DiscardColor is different in Debug/Release?

I'm usually working with the Release version but I had to switch back to Debug for some GPU leaks I'm searching and some of my RTs became 'purple-tinted'. Right now when using MG in Debug mode and Release mode may give different results because of that patch. Personally I think both versions should give always the same results, but that's just a personal preference.

Anyways, I think that if there's no ulterior motive DiscardColor should be writable. Right now to get the same results on Debug/Release I have to either:
* clear the render target myself to black with an #ifdef DEBUG (which is ugly considering that MG should be multiplatform, yet doesn't get the same results even with a debug/release change)
* clear the RT to black without the ifdef (clearing twice, losing performance)
* use PreserveContents and clear always (dangerous and prone to errors)

making DiscardColor writable to your desired clear color would result in cleaner code and performant.

    <CreatedDate>25/06/2019</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>25/03/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>CAKE is literally made with C# project compilation in mind, as such its much easier to call stuff like `dotnet restore` or `msbuild pack` without having to worry if you properly setuped the location of where the stuff is found on each platform.

CAKE scripts are just C# scripts with some predefined methods, any C# function can be called from them because of this. Its also much easier to read the build script logic as its just C# code.

    <Title>Discussion for removing Protobuild and migrating to new(er) style csproj</Title>

    <Description>## Tasks

I don't think we should migrate the installer. Instead we should replace it with nugets (and possibly another way to distribute the Pipeline Tool).

To make things usable, but not offer a full replacement we need to fix any failing tests for MGCB on .NET Core, making sure its dependencies all work. Other than that we just need to publish NuGets:
- nugets for Core projects
- nugets for dotnet new templates
- MGCB global tool nuget

We could already publish nuget 1 and 2 without fixing 3, because they use cra0zy's Content.Builder nuget to pull in MGCB (running on .NET Framework).

To fully migrate we need to:
- Distribute the pipeline tool someway
- Finish DesktopGL VideoPlayer: #6860 (so we can drop the Mac platform)
- Provide a VSIX that installs the dotnet new samples (mentioned in #6842)

Bonus:
- F# and VB templates
- Let the CAKE script upload develop nugets to a feed (myget or GitHub nuget feed)

___________

This issue is for tracking and discussing how to migrate from Protobuild generated project files to sdk-style csproj files.

Related:
- #6207 Issue for removing Protobuild
- #6650 PR that moves source files for globbing with sdk-style csproj

We will set up pull requests separately to add the csproj for each platform.

________________

Additionally we should look at the following issues once we remove Protobuild:
- #5339 #4975 Supporting .NET Standard will be easy
- #6137 Support `dotnet build`
- #6144 Switch to nugets for dependencies; this would make dependency management so much easier. We could set up a nuget feed on GitHub's [Package Registry]( on teamcity or on myget to have our custom-built stuff hosted.
- #6649 can be closed when Protobuild is gone
- #5751 and #5192 Publish development builds and pull request builds to a NuGet feed.</Description>

Just installed the Visual Studio development branch from the website, install goes fine.  Selected 2017 as that's what I have and all looks good.  I can create new projects in C# easily, but get an error with VB.

The project file
'C\Users\Me\AppData\Local\Temp\iocuhrt1.vr4\Temp\MonoGame Windows 10 Universal Project1\vbproj' cannot be opened.

There is a missing project subtype.
Subtype: '[A5A43C5b-DE2A-4C0C-9213-0A381AF9435A]' is unsupported by this installation.


Can you please send me/post a link to a working file?  I really, really want to get this up and running, I have legacy VB code I need to work with, I am not converting to C#.

Many thanks.

Is it possible to Make MG not dependent on the Visual Studio version? 

A new VS 2019 is out. And MG templates are missing for vs2019. Again. Same has happened when a vs2015 and vs2010 was out.

Is it possible to create an online visual studio extension template and publish it to marketplace.visualstudio.com ? It can solve the main problem: when new Visual Studio is out no need to wait for the next MonoGame release, it just needs to upgrade the online visual studio extension template to get support new VS/

    <Title>Linux/SDL: IsKeyDown() is reporting in a key repeat pattern, not like on Windows</Title>
    <CreatedDate>17/06/2019</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>19/06/2019</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>When I check IsKeyDown() I get a sporadic report of keypresses which doesn't work as it does in XNA/Windows. What you get is something like you'd expect while writing in Word if you hold a key down, where the key event fires are coming in a line of text being typed slowly every so often. But we don't want that of course.

This issue is still present, basically: 

I tried the fix here but I can't figure out how to update the .dylib's in my game folder, it didn't work for me: 

Ubuntu 16.04 TLS 64-bit
MonoGame 3.6.0.1625
DesktopGL

It's annoying but I found a cool workaround: just poll the key states independently and less often, and it can function quite well, not as responsive but workable and without jitteriness:

&gt;				//player input
&gt;				isAdownTimer = new System.Timers.Timer();
&gt;				isAdownTimer.Interval = 90;
&gt;				isAdownTimer.Elapsed += (sender, e) =&gt; { _isAdown = false; };
&gt;				isAdownTimer.Start();
&gt;
&gt;			        System.Timers.Timer isAdownTimer;
&gt;			        bool _isAdown;
&gt;
in Update()
&gt;			        if(Keys.A.down()) { _isAdown = true; isAdownTimer.Stop(); isAdownTimer.Start(); }
&gt;
&gt;			        if(_isAdown)
&gt;				{

UAPGameWindow.cs calls ApplicationView.SetPreferredMinSize in the Initialize method, which overrides the window preferences set by the developer, and there are no parameters to override the default 640x480 setting.

In my case, I want a minimum width &lt; 640 and the window auto-resizes to 640 every time the game starts.

Please remove this code so developers can set their own preferred minimum window size.

TouchPanel fails to age touches between updates without events.
This becomes a problem on swipes where the user holds the finger stationary for a moment and makes `.TryGetPreviousLocation()` unusable. Only took a quick glance, but this issue seems to be responsible for a significant portion of unresolved touch issues.

The test was run using a rendertarget and a vertice primitive model the render target was drawn using spritebatch. Under the following basic procedure to observe the behavior.

The rendertarget can be seen under this test as i increase the alpha to the maximum to turn the render target drawn area black. While the alpha for the clear color varys at no time is green ever added.

    <Title>SpriteFont Proposed change to cut out the middle man.</Title>
    <CreatedDate>22/05/2019</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>23/05/2019</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Currently sprite font has 2 ways to get at the glyphs and both are round about functionally or optimally.

GetGlyphs() which returns a dictionary but its useless unless you cache that or you will get tons of garbage. 

Caching it isn't a real option because spriteBatch drawString can't use your cached dictionary.
SpriteFont is also sealed so you can't just encapsulate it if you want to add functionality to your own custom methods. 

Then 

There is glyphs[] which is readonly and thats fine but whats not fine is that it is an array instead of a dictionary which is like ok... now you can direct access it, but its now the Wrong Type.

With a fat ugly slow method to search for a glyph actually being in the array that is executed in the inner loop of each drawstring. Instead of a dictionary and direct access to it.

Further this call is not accessible **internal int GetGlyphIndexOrDefault(char c)** which sort of makes getting a array even more pointless because the user can't use pointers to access the underlying calls himself from his project. In order to duplicate any speed mitigation the pointer method might give to make up for not having a dictionary.

So in other words whats going on fundamentally is two different ideas are in play and both have the opposite problem and both are basically just acting as middle men (frustration) to what really should be the correct answer to getting at the glyphs.

**public dictionary glyphs;** // or even read only doesn't matter

**what is needed is glyphs to be a dictionary and direct access to it** 

(read the very bottom for why its both a speed hit and flexibility problem for extending functionality the way it is now.)

but.. since its not 
and changing it now **would break it**.

I would like to make the suggestion that one of the two non breaking changes be made to the spritefont class or the better breaking change be made.

**1)** (the superior breaking change) 
Make glyphs a public dictionary and readonly if necessary, 
set it in the constructor using GetGlyphs() 
removing that huge ugly indexing method that checks for a key.
replacing it with containsKey.
 
this would effect all the lines from 263 to 314 essentially removing all but  a couple of them and replacing code in the method GetGlyphOrIndex(char c)
with something like akin to this.

``

in the constructor glyphs = GetGlyphs();  at the end to set it;
in the class declaration as Dictionary&lt;char, Glyph&gt;glyphs; // readonly if requisite

**2)** (the inferior change)
Same as the above but make it a addition to the class. leaving the list in also. Then the same steps as discussed above just name it something else.  glyphsDictionary or something.
Thats double the memory for the glyphs struct as it's two copys, still better then the list.
You can still eliminate all that indexing code.
... i would never use the list version given the choice it is inferior and can cause real slow downs when writing a lot of text and it gets much worse as the font size increases comparatively.

**3)** (the semi inferior or possibly the most inferior change) 
unmark the spritefont class as a final class.
public class SpriteFont{ 
.
This option could be slightly better then (2) as one can possibly just new over the class. Essentially mock it up on load to do (1) in roundabout way im not 100% this is possible though. 
Or 
You can encapsulate spritefont and wrap the load method and every font that comes in as well as include the additional required dictionary. This is a lot of work that will need repeated in each project and then monogame wont really be changed for it. This will only work on a users custom methods but at least it wont roadblock you at every turn.


Its always been a annoyance every time i write a method or mess with anything that has to do with text and the spritefont class. Well today i was streamlining old methods so i don't have to cache and found it is basically impossible to get around this without deoptimizing spritebatch or caching via a wrapper... and a wrapper wouldn't be the right thing to do. Encapsulating it would be but the damn class is marked final probably for like a .01% speed boost. Which won't mean anything at all if i have to use a array and search that array were i should have a way to directly search a dictionary in the spritefont.

Just in case anyone doesn't get what im saying, a huge font with thousands of characters having to search in a loop that draws those characters on each iteration a character array with thousands of indices takes a shitload longer then just a few hops thru a dictionary and the more characters the worse the situation gets its basically a n^2 situation - random * n  vs a dictionary which is basically linear like a  log(n) or something basically some linear value * n in time basically its way way less looping the bigger the character array gets.

I use latest MonoGame 3.7.1.189.
I don't have a buggy phone to test. But Google reports me that my games crash at the start on many phones.
Same issue with MG 3.7.
Monogame 3.6 works fine.

I've been trying to get my Xbox One Wireless controller (`030000005e040000fd02000003090000`, according to SDL2 Gamepad Tool) to work with Monogame.

Monogame does not seem to find the Gamepad, as `GamePad.GetCapabilities(PlayerIndex.One).IsConnected` always returns `false`. I'm currently using the controller through Bluetooth. The controller works fine on Steam.

I did notice that the controller is detected as a joystick by Monogame. However, the identifier of the joystick shows up as `0000045e-0000-0000-fd02-000000000000` on Monogame if read `Joystick.GetCapabilities(0).Identifier`, which strikes as a bit odd to me.

Any idea what's up?

- Black and White
- Indexed 1bpp
- Indexed 2bpp

Reasons why this should be added:
- Proper indexed textures are hard to support through shaders in a way they can be properly loaded, saved and edited from one format to another.
- Visual studio supports these image formats in the IDE proving that they can be made on newer 
 hardware 
- These can be used to easily create retro style games in which are still quite popular.

Does anyone have any objections to exposing (as an optional parameter) the instance base index in the call:

`DrawInstancedPrimitives(PrimitiveType primitiveType, int baseVertex, int startIndex, int primitiveCount, int instanceCount)`

Currently the instance base index is hardcoded to 0 inside of the private method `PlatformDrawInstancedPrimitives.`

My proposal is to modify DrawInstancedPrimitives to have the following signature:

`DrawInstancedPrimitives(PrimitiveType primitiveType, int baseVertex, int startIndex, int primitiveCount, int instanceCount, int instanceIndex = 0)`

This will preserve existing usage and behavior but allow you to optionally set a different base index for the instances.

Reason being is that I have a circular buffer of instance data and I want to draw different sections of it without having to also have separate and multiple SetData calls. With this change I can set the data once and have separate draw calls drawing from different sections of the set instance data.

Issue 651 sounds like the same problem, but that ticket was closed.
I'm using MonoGame 3.7.1.189 (NuGet package).

I get the following error:
System.InvalidOperationException: This image format is not supported occurred

Let me explain a little deeper.

`
using (var mem = new MemoryStream(rawPng))
            {
                this.texture1 = Texture2D.FromStream(this.GraphicsDevice, mem);
            }
`
I've tried to isolate the issue as much as possible, to the point where I've a byte[] in source code, and are trying to load that.  In fact, I've multiple files in source!  There's one I call "Ordained by God", because it is blessed with the power to load and work!  Yes, a PNG that loads!

All the other PNGs I have are variations.  I've tried saving a PNG from Cosmigo's Promotion (the working file, and also failing files) as well as loading the failing PNG into GIMP, and re-saving as a PNG again.  I've tried re-saving as a 24bit file too.  I've even resorted to try saving the PNG from Microsoft Paint, - and they ALL generate PNGs that work in Windows, but under Android, they all refuse to load, except the one ordained by God.  (Bub and Bob from BubbleBobble, as it happens).

Lastly, out of desperation, I also tried generating a 300k byte[] that's a BMP file, not PNG.
I thought that might work - but it didn't. 

I'm happy to share my isolated project.
[SpriteBatchTexturesDemo.zip](

Pretty please, I'd love to get to the bottom of this one.
Is there something I need to know, or are missing?

at the top of the Game1.cs file I've a region:

`
 #region data to convert back into a byte[] to load into a Texture2d.
`

In which you can comment out the binaries you are not concerned with.
Note that the first one ("bub n bob") actually works!

We're trying to establish why the others don't.

    <Description>Hello everybody,

MonoGame gives an empty window on macOS Mojave.
It does work correctly High Sierra, there everything is painted as expected.
So there seems an incompatibilty that started with Mojave.

This problem can very easily be reproduced with Mac OS Sample:

When running that demo on Mojave you should notice the color set is not rendered.

Originally I suspected it was an SDL issue.
There is a bug report here that seems a match:

However, even SDL 2.0.9 is showing the issue with Monogame.
And there the bug was claimed to be fied.

So it could be something else is going on.
Can someone else also please take a look?
Thanks!

I have a Processor to generate a sprite atlas that overrides TextureProcessor and generates mipmaps for individual sprites to avoid Color bleeding between sprites.

As soon as I call base.Process(), it will overwrite/replace my mipmaps.
This is different than what XNA does. As a workaround I had to do this in MG:

``

Here is the code of my Processor:


That's the line in TextureProcessor that generates Mipmaps.
It should call GenerateMipmaps(bool overwriteExistingMipmaps) with false.

    <Description>Hello Monogame Community,

I think the pipeline tool is broken for Ubuntu. I try to build the following mgcb

``

If i start the pipeline tool, it will run infinitely long. However, I can cancel the process, but no output was generated. I also run the pipeline tool in debug mode and from the console, but there is no stack trace or anything I can work with.

Maybe it's relevant: I added a custom Pipeline dll into the references in another session (mgcb). But this should not affect this file I think?

A text file set to COPY build action gets skipped if the file has changed using the "Build" command. You have to "Rebuild" every time in order to get the file changes.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a xml file to the content project
2. Set the content item to Copy instead of Build
3. Build the content project
4. Make a change to the xml file and save
5. Build the content project - file is skipped and doesn't appear in the Build Output log

    <Description>Hi all. I can't seem to get MonoGame 3.7.1 to work on Visual Studio Community 2017. Whenever I add a project, whether it's Shared Code, Windows, or Cross-Platform, the project adds successfully, then Visual Studio stops responding. When I close VS with my task manager and open the project again (either the .sln or the .csproj file), Visual Studio opens the project then immediately stops responding. Am I missing something obvious or is there an issue here?

Hi, it actually broke some compatibility with EmptyKeys GUI framework. Bad thing is that its source code is not open. But with this version of code and EmptyKeysUI_MonoGame version 3.1.0 from nuget I get
`Method not found: 'Void Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteBatch..ctor(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsDevice)'."} | System.MissingMethodException`

This happens when I call MonoGameEngine constructor which initialize EmptyKeys GUI stuff and creates SpriteBrach instance(s) internally.
My assumption is that method signature within MonoGame.Framework.dll changes enough to break compatibility at least for EmptyKeys but it might be the same case for more libraries out there.</Description>

This is not included with the standard project templates and causes errors on loading.

Ideally a default one should be included that the user can tailor, instead of causing confusion on load.

The log starts off with the windowed game being in the foreground (~45 fps), I then switch to the game window (fps jumps to ~3900), and then switch to another app (fps drops back to 45). 

However, the issue is there when VSync is on and fixed timestep is on as well, but the drop is less dramatic, from 60fps to 45fps.

#### Repro steps ####

- Create a new project
- Add some way to measure FPS, e.g.

            this.frameCount++;
            if (this.stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds &gt; 2500)
            {
                Debug.WriteLine($"FPS: {(double)this.frameCount * 1000 / this.stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds:F2}, " +
                                $"VTrace on: {this.graphics.SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace}, " +
                                $"Fixed timestep on:{this.IsFixedTimeStep}, " +
                                $"requested timestep: {this.TargetElapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds}ms");

                this.stopWatch.Restart();
                this.frameCount = 0;
            }
`</Code>
    <Description>The issue described is present in 3.7.1 and 3.8 latest dev build, and _not_ present in 3.7.0

After the MonoGame window loses focus (e.g. when I alt-tab to another window), the draw calls seem to be capped at around 45 FPS. 

Here's a FPS report from running an empty MonoGame project with VSync disabled:

``
- Run the game
- Observe the higher FPS
- Alt-tab to some other window
- Note the FPS drop.

I am currently writing my own map editor using MonoGame for two reasons. 
a&gt; To master MonoGame, and 
b&gt; To preserve this map system as the programming language I originally wrote it in is hardly maintained anymore ;)
I've been creating my own lay-out and stuff in it all to get the utmost out of myself.

However during test runs (in both debug and release builds) something odd happens.
When I start up, the app runs full screen in 1920x1080 screen mode, but when I move the mouse down, I suddenly get back into my Windows screens, but my application doesn't close, however when I click the icon again on the task bar I get back into my editor but now in 720x576 screen mode. 

Now the source code can be found [here]( but if you need specific parts of the code, just tell me.

I have an assembly that uses Newtonsoft.Json for a custom importer. When I attempt to add the assembly as a reference in the content pipeline tool, I get a crash with the following exception:

``

If I edit the Content.mgcb file manually to add the reference, I simply get an error window that says, "Content.mgcb: Failed to open the project due to an unknown error."

This previously worked under the same conditions with MonoGame 3.6. I'm currently using a relative path to my assembly. The NewtonSoft.Json assembly is in the same folder. I have also tried absolute paths.</Description>

&lt;s&gt;`SpriteBatcher` class has a member `private VertexPositionColorTexture[] _vertexArray;`. When draw count per seconds goes to 150000-20000 per second. That array member size get increased heavely, and then cause high latency GC on next batch draw.&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;This may be the reason my game's draw lag, which can go to 300ms, and 80ms on average draw.&lt;/s&gt;

EDIT: This is not that reason cause lag. I must be something in other place.

And it becomes more worse if you enable AlphaTestEffect on most of the batch draw.

Hi, I experienced a weird issue, trying to playing Songs under iOS.
I imported my_song.mp3 file via content pipeline (using "Mp3 Importer - MonoGame") and load and play it as follows:
`
Song msx = Content.Load&lt;Song&gt;("my_song");
Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaPlayer.Play(msx);
`

All the things goes well, no errors was generated and the `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaPlayer.State` is "Playing", but no music is audible (of course, the volume is correctly set...).
I tried with various format/version of mp3 and also with .ogg, with the same result.

I tried to downgrade to release 3.6 and the above code works well. In simulator and in real devices the songs play fine.
So, I think it’s an issue of the latest 3.7 / 3.7.1 releases of MonoGame.
I am very curious to discover the reasons of this bug... 
Any idea?

    <Description>Hello,

it appears to me that the process of building the solution/project files through Protobuild.exe is currently broken. I get a bunch of 404 errors when trying to run the .exe as it pings home to protobuild.org to get more stuff, which makes sense because that domain now belongs to some social media exposure boosting abomination. Are any alternatives available at this time?

**Autocomplete/intellisense does not work in a Monogame Shared project.**

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new Monogame Shared project.
2. Right click on the solution and create a new Monogame DX or OpenGL project.
3. Add the shared project as a reference to the DX/GL project.
    a. When I do this, the using statement in the shared project `using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage;` throws an error: "The type or namespace 'Storage' does not exist in the namespace 'Monogame.XNA.Framework'." I'm not sure what's up with that.
4. Create a new class in the shared project.
5. Begin typing the 'prop' shortcut for creating a property. 
6. There is no autocomplete or intellisense. Pressing TAB does not trigger the prop shortcut. Also, I am unable to use the `;` character at all.

I'm only able to fix this by unloading and reloading the shared project, but I don't want to have to do that every time I make a new class.

I'm using Visual Studio Professional 2017 Version 15.9.4, as well as JetBrains ReSharper Ultimate 2018.3.1.

The parameter order in MonoGame.Content.Builder.targets for MGCB.exe seems to be wrong in concern of cross-platform projects. The /platform paramter should come after the /@ parameter in order to correctly overwrite the platform in order to have platform specific projects (with shared content) built their content correctly.

..in the current order the /platform parameter is always ignored when a .mgcb file is provided - which happens to be the case in cross-platform with shared project

The Pipeline tool appears to have an issue with the UI when working with .tmx files from Tiled. After adding a reference to Monogame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll, the tool reports "Invalid / Missing Importer(Processor)" in the Properties window after selecting Content project files. Also, after adding a .tmx file to the Content project, it looks like this in the Content.mgcb file:

``
The Content project builds fine, however, even when right-clicking on the .tmx file and selecting Rebuild.

    <Description>Hello there,

This is something to put in your pipe and smoke... Or open discussion.

I have recently been interested in seeing if MonoGame could work with [Blazor]( I have come to the conclusion that I will have to wait for .Net Core support  planned in [3.8 Release](

Two of the [Use Cases for Web Assembly]( are Virtual Reality and games, both of which MonoGame would be great for.

I am also interested by a WebVR project called [A-Frame]( which uses ThreeJS and I believe that in the future MonoGame could be used for a similar project built from server-side [Razor Components]( rather than client-side (custom) HTML.

In fact the [demo on the Web Assembly website]( is Tanks! which is a Unity game, built in C# I would assume (unless the Wasm guys converted to C++), so it is realistic to think that MonoGame could also be used with Web Assembly in the same way.

As well as all this, a MonoGame web app built with Blazor could also open up [Electron]( and [Cordova]( as new platforms.

What do you think about all this?  
Blazor is still experimental so it could be distant future stuff, but still possible.

    <Description>#### What operating system are you using:
- Windows, DesktopGL

There is a rendering difference between the DirectX and OpenGL versions of MonoGame when using the BasicEffect. Because the half pixel offset for OpenGL is not taken into account. While this is taken into account for the SpriteBatch:

Game.Framework/Graphics/GraphicsDevice.OpenGL.cs#L272

This means that anything rendered with the BasicEffect shader is slightly blurry on OpenGL. For example see these two screenshots:

OpenGL:
![text_a](

DirectX:
![text_c](

I think we should give the user some way to know that the half pixel offset should be set by themselves or change the OpenGL shader for the BasicEffect to fix this.

What do you think? I can make a PR once I've gathered more input :).</Description>

I've used MonoGame for about a year, but then decided to switch languages, and ended up on `Rust`.
I have missed MonoGame, but I don't really want to leave Rust as it's an amazing programming language. So I came up with the idea to integrate rust with MonoGame, and thought that perhaps the math portion could be ported for ease of use instead of anything too complicated to put into an FFI. I wrote a test and, low and behold, I have great results:

### Matrix.CreateLookAt()

|                            | MonoGame Implementation | Rust native implementation |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time (Ticks)               | 17 551 010.16           | 314 615.39                 |
| Time (MS)                  | 5273.5                  | 94.5                       |
| Memory (MB) (VS Debugger)  | 71.1                    | 76.2                       |
| Memory (MB) (Task Manager) | 68.5                    | 69.1                       |
| CPU% (Task Manager)        | 15 ~ 17.5              | 16 ~ 18.5                 |

Here is my configuration for reference:

|                  | Config                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Target (Rust)    | nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc `--release` |
| Target (C#)      | Any CPU (Release)                          |
| OS               | Windows 10                                 |
| MonoGame version | Latest Stable (3.7.1)                      |
| .Net version     | .Net Framework 4.7.1                       |
| CPU              | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz    |
| Ticks Per Second | 3328129 |

So I'm asking, _if_ I were to rewrite alot of the math functions in MonoGame in Rust, would it ever be accepted? (Of course I'd make sure to keep the implementation outputting the same result)

[The source for my tests](

Edit:
I later realized, that while rust _does_ compile to many platforms, it doesn't compile to all, so it _may_ not have support for some of the less prominent targets that MonoGame targets.
Edit 2:
I was actually looking at DateTime for ticks per second, but I was actually using the StopWatch.Frequency ticks per second</Description>

The problem with this is in any game were you might allow the user to assign or use control group keys.
Strategy games often do this and really any game were you want to allow the user to assign arbitrary hotkeys or control groups.
This is the only monogame way to really do this, as text input isn't made for this idea.

You normally check that any keys are pressed first by getting this method. 
Checking if its length is more then zero you then procced to process the keys pressed instead of checking for every single possible key combination with getstate which would be insane.

Simply calling this method creates garbage.
Since it is a array of keys and keys are structs. It appears to be boxing and unboxing.

The couple methods associated with it have a number of odditys which appear redundant and overly complex. All for the sake of apparently avoiding garbage which it doesn't do.


Ill post my notes i took while looking it over.


        // All three methods associated with GetPressedKeys are heavily using bitwise math to count bits.
        // https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/Input/KeyboardState.cs
        // The array is returned after being populated in .... KeyboardState.GetPressedKeys.
        // It populates the array primarily by calling  ... AddKeysToArray(uint keys, int offset, Keys[] pressedKeys, int index)
        //
        // 256 bit flags are being stored across 8 32 bit unsigned integers they are being treated as a bit array.
        //
        // Array of 256 bits:
        // uint keys0, keys1, keys2, keys3, keys4, keys5, keys6, keys7;
        //
        // It is based on this which seems out of place here.
        // http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#CountBitsSetParallel
        //
        // The count method is only used so that a keys struct array of the correct length can be created.
        // There is no way for the user to make use of the count even though this has been calculated.
        // It generates garbage by calling the method since this is a array of structs boxing must be occuring.
        // 
`</Code>
    <Description>Windows Gl crossplatform desktop tested while windowed.
This is probably the same on Dx.

_I don't think this is the same as 6601 as i tested that without even using keyboard at all and it is constant.
This varys with the amount of times its called per minute and the state of the keyboard._

In the class keyboardstate here.


The method GetPressedKeys() which returns a Array of Keys which are structs is generating garbage.

The following code generates tons of garbage with fix timestep off. This does build to collections.
With it on at 60 frames per second its not too bad it will generate a collection every minute or so.

    <Description>Dunno how to close this myself but i guess it can be closed.

I don't know if this is possible but it would be nice.

Id like a way to register to a event that is raised on 
Any keys pressed or down ect... and that passes GameTime as a parameter. 

So that i can make a callback to bypass having to poll in update specifically im trying to make a keyboard class that only calls getstate when it needs to.
Much like how textinput is raised as a callback for character keys space enter backspace tab and insert.

So any time getstate would be populated the event or action or func would be raised.

Essentially i want to bypass polling Keyboard.GetState() every update. Atm i need to have a update method for my keyboard class, which isn't a big deal.
However, if i want to compartmentalize it without having to poll getstate every update that's not really possible and this would sort of make it possible to use keyboard like textinput and it would be kind of nice if there was a uniformed way to use them.

Which is what i was dabling with and why im asking.

Here is how my game1 looks currently in the update you can see below it would be nicer looking to just get rid of the KeyBoard.Update if there was a event raised for any key that passed gametime i could just poll getstate in my keyboard class.

``
Just in case anyone is curious i can post the rest of it or the project if you like there is a keyboard info class also with the keyboard class that i had to align with the keys enum. It basically just catagorizes keys in relation to text input not both as well as the kind of key pressed. As it is both events can end up fired sometimes if it makes sense to and can be ignored or not in one method or the other by the user.</Description>

MonoGame 3.7 has a regression from 3.6 where the iOS audio session category is incorrectly set to `AVAudioSessionCategory.SoloAmbient` in `OpenALSoundController.cs`.

This immediately stops background music and breaks the workaround in issue #735, which was to set the audio session category to `AVAudioSessionCategory.Ambient` in `FinishedLaunching`.

In my opinion, MonoGame should not override the audio category set by the developer, and this code should be deleted.

For one of my games (a party game where audio is essential) I want to use `AVAudioSessionCategory.Playback` with the option `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.MixWithOthers` and `SecondaryAudioShouldBeSilencedHint` in order to create an experience where my game sound effects always play (even if the ringer is muted) and my background music only plays if some other background music isn't already playing.

For another of my games (a puzzle game where audio is not essential), I want to use `Ambient` so my sound is silenced when the ringer is muted.

My point is that there isn't a single category that the MonoGame framework should dictate for every game. The framework should leave this setting up to the game developer.

Also note that MonoGame is not setting `AVAudioSessionCategory` when the application is resumed/activated, so I'm able to get the correct behavior if the user switches back to the music app, restarts the music, and switches back to my game. However, I don't consider this a viable workaround.

When using the MonoGame addin, the project is created just fine, but it is always appended by '.Desktop'. For example, if I make `projectfoo`, the actual project is renamed to `projectfoo.Desktop`. And there is a warning that that reads _Invalid configuration mapping_ that shows up next to the project name (but not the solution) in MonoDevelop. Opening the solution file in MonoDevelop does not allow the project to build. I get the error:


Thread finished: Finalizer #2
Cannot open assembly '/home/brian/Projects/monogame/monogame/bin/DesktopGL/Any CPU/Debug/monogame.Desktop.exe': No such file or directory.


Finally, if I open the `.csproj` file directly, instead of the `.sln` file in MonoDevelop, I can work with the software, and it builds and runs just fine. The downside is that it creates another `.sln` file in the same directory as the `.csproj` file.

I don't know why this does this. I also don't know if there is a command line build or project generator I should be using instead. Any help would be appreciated. 

I have attached a screenshot of what the MonoDevelop window looks like. This is right after I started a new MonoGame project using the addin. I have not edited any of the files

    <Description>IntermediateSerializer(Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Serialization.Intermediate namespace) doesn't work properly. Everything is working fine while you're deserializing XML, but when you try to serialize something, nothing happens at all.


Code from there works with XNA library and doesn't work with one from MonoGame.

If you run this code with referenced MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Portable.dll, it will cause an empty console:

    using System;
    using System.Xml;
    using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Serialization.Intermediate;

    <Description>In #6535 a `TimerHelper` class was added to utilities. New classes should go in the `MonoGame` namespace, but `TimerHelper` was put in the `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Utilities` namespace (because the change was made a long time ago).

The namespace should be changed [here]( to `MonoGame.Utilities`. Possibly the usage [here]( needs to be modified to match.

This is a good first issue if you'd like to contribute to MonoGame :) Don't know how to handle Git or have any questions -&gt; chat with us on the [Gitter channel]( or respond to this issue.</Description>

    <Description>&lt;!-- Write your issue below --&gt;
If you make a new project with monogame and add one image to the Content.mgcb, the outputDir from it isnt used to move the compiled files. Lets assume the project is named "ContentGame", after compile you get that directory chaos:

ContentGame
-ContentGame
--bin
---Windows
----Content (empty)
----x86
-----Debug (game.exe)
------Content (with the image)
--Content
---bin
----Windows
-----Content (with the image too...)
---obj
----Windows
-----Content
--obj
---Windows
----Content (empty)
---x86
----Debug
--Properties
![grafik](

Why are so many empty and wrong Content folders?
If I set the outputDir to C:\Projects\Game\Content\ it should be there. If you use the pipeline tool, it works.

EDIT:  I have looked how to fix it. There are two lines I changed to get rid of the extra content folders:
``

AND if you remove the parameters from RunContentBuilder it used, as I expected, te settings. But it doesnt copy the files to the exe directory any more.. (I have no need, but maybe someone will ;))

    <Title>Practical problem keyboard input. </Title>
    <CreatedDate>01/12/2018</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>02/12/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I have been doing quite a bit of text stuff lately and come up on a seemingly unsolvable situation.

First problem.  The monogame Keyboard class is all messed up big time. 
**Some keys are straight up missing in the keys enum common ones... Less than, More than, Hyphen, Forward slash ect...**

In the not so odd case were i want to press control and use that like a command shortcut with another key like w or m i can maybe get it to work with keyboardstate but if want to do this with a special character at all many of them such as a bracket { or ` &lt; &gt; / [ ] ' ; . 

**Keyboard state doesn't actually return a shifted case key properly or un-shifted keys right for that matter.** 

For example here is some test output were i hold shift in all presses 
notice i get ? instead of / and yet i get , . instead of  &lt; &gt;. 

while pressing the Shifted keys i should get  &lt;&gt; ?
Un-shifted the keys i should get are this   , . /

&gt; key[0] LeftShift isCommand True isShift True isNumeric False isCharacter False isSpecialCharacter False
&gt; key[1] OemComma isCommand False isShift False isNumeric False isCharacter True isSpecialCharacter True
&gt; 
&gt; key[0] LeftShift isCommand True isShift True isNumeric False isCharacter False isSpecialCharacter False
&gt; key[1] OemPeriod isCommand False isShift False isNumeric False isCharacter True isSpecialCharacter False
&gt; 
&gt; key[0] LeftShift isCommand True isShift True isNumeric False isCharacter False isSpecialCharacter False
&gt; key[1] OemQuestion isCommand False isShift False isNumeric False isCharacter True isSpecialCharacter True
&gt; 

It returns the upper keys and lower keys without pressing anything else as well essentially whats returned in the array is unmodified by shift. The upper key or lower returned key seems random but constantly shift doesn't modify it at all.

**On the other hand.**

Text input cannot be used to determine a character pressed when something like the "control" key prevents the event from being raised. **Also when one presses shift and a letter the passed Arguments.Key evaluates to keys.None not Shift which is inconsistent with the other control keys that raise the event.** 

This leaves you with the only other option being Keyboard GetState.

The problem with GetState "Shift" it's borked big time.
**Which also means the enum for Keys has a bunch of codes that GetState never ever return.**
 
Can i know 100% the shift key characters are the same for the keys someone else presses on there keyboard even if the upper or lower case was consistently returned. Shift should be modifying which key is returned.

&lt;img src= " &gt;

&lt;img src= " &gt;

**This begs the questions,,,** 

This lead to... the user hard coding shifted control key characters to some crazy mapping ?
Which then begs the question should i expect every keyboard to have the same shift characters above the same keys ?

**The impossibility of these two scenarios then combines into something really frustrating...**

TextInput as is can't simply replace keyboard input nor can it be used in combination with it properly.

I cannot mix the textinput event with the polling as i cannot even see that shift is pressed in the raised event ... So i can't from the raised event method get the keystate to try to see that shift is the control key pressed that way.
Remember that the raised event argument for text input returns NONE as the argument when shift is pressed.

Conversely i can't poll to the raised method previously fired from my update method to get character keys from text input to hack in as a way to do short cut keys as they don't fire if i hit control, so in some game i can't reliably say control + any special key or control shift any key reliably with either. Even if it was just raised, calling into it is useless when its not raised on control or alt or many others. 
So no key character or argument will be good anyways other then shift and that actual isn't passed as a argument which means i have to fall back to Keyboard state to see if shift is pressed for any reason ?.
Also control arrows insert and many other control keys do not allow the raising of the the text input event at all. So any sort of short cut key via text input is not practically possible in any sort of simple to do way when trying to have a full and simple solution for input and is only semi reliable with keyboardstate.

Which leaves exactly no way to detect reliably that the user pressed something like control + / or &gt;.

The general user will have to hope their keyboard layout is just like mine and i hard code it with some wacky unshift shift mapping for any kind of command keys i want to add like control * and the next programmer will too. 
Of course i know they wont all have the same layout.

Which im about to do in some limited way in a minute or in some really weird behaviorial way to get around it because i simply can see no other way. E.G. toggle on and off control alt and shift and function keys.

&lt;img src= " &gt;

Worse even if it was working perfectly with the keyboardstate you need something like this to convert keys to characters properly on different keyboards
``

**Its crazy to have two separate keyboard input classes were neither fully work and they don't work with each other.**

Its ugly.  
The best solution i can see is to only rely on keyboard state for the simplest things it's not even good enough for control groups or special commands instead. Raise a separate event for text input when any key is pressed and let the user decide if he needs to do anything with keys he may not care about control alt or shift key function keys ect. If that is doable ?

Char itself in c# can tell you if a actual utf16 returned character is a control separator whitespace or what not on its own in any language.

God forbid if you really wanted to _press control shift /_ .
Try to write out the code to detect that on a us keyboard atm and you will see how frustrating this is currently. Because right now under monogame on my keyboard this is actually 100% impossible to do and i don't mean i don't know how i mean its impossible with the classes that monogame has.


If someone wants to educate me on what im missing id be quite abliged but so far this is all from running tests and the tests are telling me its really borked. I think it needs a bit of consideration.

    <CreatedDate>25/11/2018</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>25/11/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I've been creating a mostly SpriteBatch 2d game using the DesktopGL template. After recently upgrading my game from MonoGame 3.6 to 3.7 I started receiving reports that players who could play my game using MonoGame 3.6 but could no longer play using MonoGame 3.7.

One of my players has an old Intel Core 2 Duo with integrated graphics. Framebuffer support was provided via the EXT_framebuffer object. As of this PR (#5993) his machine no longer loads the BindFramebufferDelegate, GenFramebufferDelegate, or any of the other EXT functions which eventually leads to a NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException when trying to call those functions from PlatformApplyRenderTargets in GraphicsDevice.OpenGL.cs.

By bringing back the old EXT loading code, and code in the Framebufferhelper.cs file I was able to compile a MonoGame dll from the develop branch that he could use. Obviously [these changes]( are not suitable for a PR but I was able to prove to myself that these players can still use MonoGame 3.7+ with very minor modifications.

I guess I'm wondering if it was intended to drop support for computers that required the EXT functions (ie 'glBindFramebufferEXT') or if this is a valid issue. If it's valid I can devote more time and attempt to find a real solution for these players that won't break other devices.

Thanks!
JC

        <Title>[OpenGL] Rework Android Framebuffer Support</Title>
        <Description>OpenTK removal also removed some support for frame buffers
on older devices. The old code was a bit of a mess with
mutliple FrameBuffer classes each doing the same thing.

This commit reworks the code to have one OpenGL FramebufferHelper
and moves all the loading of OpenGL extensions into the OpenGL.cs
class where they belong.

As a result GraphicsCapabilites was reworked to use the `Extensions`
property on the `GL` class. We also needed to rework when the
OpenGL entry points are loaded so ensure we have a current context.
If we don't we cannot get the extension strings from opengl since
it required a current context.</Description>

Hi, I recently posted a question about if the 3ds was supported as a monogame platform and one of your monogame developers answered me that if a was interested about getting this platform as a monogame supported one I should open a issue here, so here it is. It would be awesome if you could made it.

Thank you un advance.</Description>

Touches near the edge of a full screen game on iOS 11+ immediately activate system gestures like Control Center and task switching, instead of deferring them as expected in iOS 10 and earlier.

The solution is to override `preferredScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` in `iOSGameViewController` (see [Apple developer documentation]( which is not possible without a fix in MonoGame.Framework.

As the title states, i'm having issues on IOS with RenderTarget2D. I've appended reproduction code which resembles my original code. I'm unsure but It seems like an internal race condition and it happens about ~75% of the times on random moments. (which is typical for a race condition).

It's solvable - as the comment states - by not using RenderTarget2D to set the original data to... Use Texture2D instead. Still it seems like a tiny issue which perhaps can be fixed?

Thanks!

After preprocessing png images and using RenderTarget2D to to scale them, all textures of my Game in IOS turn black. My other target: Win32(Dx), WinStore(Dx), Android(GL), Mac(GL), do not show this problem.

This seems to be a regression of [#541](

Is there any way I or we can fix this?

Thanks!

There is a very minor delay before SoundEffectInstances loop with `SoundEffectInstance.IsLooped` after they're done playing. This happens on both WindowsDX and DesktopGL on the latest develop version. I've verified that the songs themselves loop correctly by playing them in Adobe Audition.

The SharpFont.dll.config file is missing from the NuGet package, which has problems on Linux platforms in particular.

I utilize the NuGet package so I can do Azure builds, so this is quite important.

    <Description>Hello,

This is a question, not an issue. 

I'm maintaining a C# wrapper for libvlc and looking into integration with game engines. Unity.Android is currently working but that's about it for now. 

Is there community interest in having a libvlc based VideoPlayer implementation integrated with MonoGame?

Cheers,

&lt;!-- Write your issue below --&gt;
Gameloop with fixed frame rate 60 FPS produce unstable timing.
The problem exist very clearly and should also affect low GPU load.
Screen's with lower refresh rate might not encounter this problem.

I have identified two problems with the gameloop timing.

1. The gameloop drift and is just below 60 fps. This will make at some point one frame loss (same frame drawn twice)
2. When idle and running Thread.Sleep() timing is cast to (int) making the wait little to short.
Because it then do RetryTick: it could make another Thread.Sleep() that will produce a significant long frame because Thread.Sleep() is not exactly and often can't produce very short delays.

**Comment:**
I suggest that the multiple Update() for long framerates and IsRunningSlowly could be removed or possible made as optional on/off. It is very confusing and hard to understand that there could be multiple Updates() for one Draw(). (I have comment out the code).

**Solution:**
1. Make the timing a little faster to produce slightly more than 60 FPS.
Decrease the sleep wait with one ms. This makes the game at some point produce one extra frame.
2. After Thread.Sleep() don't goto RetryTick() move forward instead.

**Code:**

As stated in pull request #6523, the parameter `index` (the fourth parameter) passed to the method `DataStream.Create` by the method `PlatformSubmitBuffer` of the class `DynamicSoundEffectInstance` using the XAudio back-end seems wrong. Since the buffer referred to by the method is `pooledBuffer`, and data is copied from the original buffer to this pooled buffer, the right value passed to the parameter might be `0` instead of `offset`.

    <Description>Starting a Monogame game fails with the exception: "Failed to load SDL library." when starting the game from a folder where the path contains a "#" character.

This is caused by this line: 
where the path to the sdl library is determined.

I´ve got my Monogame project in a folder called E:\C#\MyGame
`(new Uri(typeof(Sdl).Assembly.CodeBase)).LocalPath` will return "E:\C" as a path, cutting the "#" and everything after it. Therefore, the search directory is determined to be "E:\" and the sdl library can not be found.

To reproduce, simply create a project using the default template in a folder that has a "#" in its name.

    <Code>Audio namespace is used, MonoGame initialize the static OpenAL bindings and tries to load the library and its entry points, resulting in a EntryPointNotFoundException if the OpenAL binaries are missing.

This is an issue when using third party sound engines and not shipping the OpenAL binaries.

Please also note that this is broken: https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/MonoGame.Framework/SDL/SDLGamePlatform.cs#L72

The DllNotFoundException is no more triggered because the entry points loading have changed and are now throwing EntryPointNotFoundException. And even if GetNativeLibrary() would throw the correct exception type, this code won't be triggered because it happens in the static initializer and no more within the OpenALSoundController constructor.

Related to #6107 and #4717

I think we should move forward with making the Audio`</Code>

    <Description>Pipeline is looking for a `Content.mgcb` that doesn't exist. After I started seeing this issue, I deleted the project entirely in VSCode and also in the filesystem. I also tried to find relevant files in `~/Library` and `/Library`, but didn't have a lot of luck. Finally I reinstalled Pipeline but I still am seeing the issue.

I'm on Mac OS 10.11.6 and running MonoGame 3.7.

    <Description>Minor Quality of life addition to the Rectangle class. This is a proposal for 3 Rectangle overloads, LocationVector, SizeVector and CenterVector that return Vector2's. These are supplemental to the existing location Property's that return Points of the same name without the word Vector appended at the end.

Motivation...

Today for the umpteenth time i drew a Rectangle.

_Rectangle r = new Rectangle(100,100, 200, 30);
spriteBatch.Draw(.., r ,,,);_

Then i drew some text in the rectangle.

_spriteBatch,DrawString( ......  r.Location  ,,,,); // This of course would error._

so...

_Vector2 v = new Vector2(r.X, r.Y);
spriteBatch,DrawString( ......  v  ,,,,);_

The reverse going from Vector2's to Rectangle.Location or Size is annoying and you have to type the cast (int) which i know is sort of a good thing sometimes but honestly in this case not really as it has to be done and will be done anyways,

.

With the proposed addition you would have instead.

_spriteBatch,DrawString( ......  r.LocationVector  ,,,,);_

.

Now you might say this isn't a big deal and you are right. 
I typically have as extension methods ToVector2() and ToPoint() lying around.
But ...
New people don't as well it gets annoying to always have to add them.
Further this amounts to a extra call or pass and typing every time it has to be done.

How many times have these extra lines been written since the begining of xna or monogame,

I submitted a pull request hopefully i did it right. 

I know there is cache hit concerns and i didn't try to test for them but i doubt those structs are that big,
If you guys approve i would also like to submit the following...
On the Vector2 a Point type Return getter. 
On the Point a Vector2 type Return getter.
Typically i name my extensions ToPoint and ToVector

It doesn't and probably shouldn't be a overload (because it should be a explicit method or property call) but something like a ToVector method or property in the point class, (ToPoint in the vector class) would allow many to get rid of extension methods for something that probably should of been added years ago in xna. 
If nothing else to avoid a extra parameter pass between these calls and to keep the code cleaner.

    <Description>&lt;!-- Write your issue below --&gt;

I've been using CocosSharp successfully with Monogame 3.6. However, when upgrading to 3.7 (or the latest 3.8 dev build), the following code is now corrupting loaded texture data

`var b = new Color[rt.Texture.PixelsHigh * rt.Texture.PixelsWide];
                rt.Texture.XNATexture.GetData&lt;Color&gt;(b); `
                

It appears, rather than just reading out the data, to completely overwrite the texture with a section from a corner of the current screen.

To emphasise: this isn't just a case of it returning the wrong data. The texture being read becomes *corrupted and overwritten* entirely.

It seems the actual data being returned is correct. However, calling SetData on the texture straight afterwards has no effect.

When attempting to create a new solution via the MonoGame templates (MonoGame Mac Application) in the latest version of Visual Studio for Mac, I get the following error:

![new_project_and_visual_studio_community_2017_for_mac-2](

![new_project_and_visual_studio_community_2017_for_mac](

EDIT: I resolved the issue by removing the Monogame extension for VS for Mac and installing it from the NuGet gallery instead.

    <Description># Issue
As far as I can understand, the [`master`]( branch is supposed to always point to the latest release tag. In this case, [`v3.7`]( The current git log looks like this: 
``
Where `upstream` remote is MonoGame and `origin` is my form. It appears that `master` pointed to `v3.6` while that one was the latest release.

It looks like 76cb3d64e and 3d26a001c both supplied the same changes (Update changelog for 3.7 release), and at the same time, but for some reason diverged the history.

## Proposed Resolution
`git diff master v3.7` produces no output so the code is at least identical. The only reasonable change I can think of (if any change at all should be done) would be to move the v3.7 tag from 3d26a001c to 0146cf60f. Looking at the previous releases, the tags were always assigned to master once it merged the latest release changes. So this is what should have happened at least.

That can obviously be a bad idea if anyone (foolishly) has added commits on their fork to the v3.7 tag.

I'm not sure how big of a deal this is, but I thought it would be worth bringing up.</Description>

    <Description>Start up Windows Universal project with remote machine option for Xbox One.
Notice game screen is not positioned correctly on screen. e.g. off the top left and not filling the entire screen.
As a side the resolution is 1728 x 972 which seems odd.
See screenshot for more information.

    <Description>It seems I have stumbled upon a problem when using content pipeline. I have just freshly formatted my PC (am running WIN 10, build 1709) and the latest version of VS 2017. After reading that monogame just "levelled up" to 3.7 I figured to give it a go. After pulling a project from my GitHub, I noticed that the VS vas throwing me messages for not building my content prior to running the game (I forgot...), so I grabbed the pipeline tool, added the same content from what was previously used, and hit build, but nothing happens, the output window remains empty, and sometimes it crashes. 

The message that is thrown by VS : Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	The command ""C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\MonoGame\v3.0\Tools\MGCB.exe" /@:"D:\Moji programi\Game1\Game1\Content\Content.mgcb" /platform:Windows /quiet /outputDir:"bin\Windows\Content" /intermediateDir:"obj\Windows\Content"" exited with code 5. Please verify that you have sufficient rights to run this command.	Game1

After upgrade to monogame 3.7, I've got an NullReferenceException on calling graphicsDevice.Dispose, if monogame is used in a wpf application. Thats because, there is no _swapChain. The line is the first line @ PlatformDispose

"if (_swapChain.IsFullScreen)" &lt;- Here should be checked whether _swapChain is not null

Before 3.7 that error not exists. I have testet on the latest dev branch on Windows 10 Prof.

The issue occurs with both nuget version (3.7.0.1708 and 3.7.0.1681-develop). 

I cloned and checkout some older commits (I'm new at this stuff, sorry if I'm using wrong terminology). Everything before  works, everything after doesn't, including this commit  
In over words if there is FuncLoader in Utilities, problem will occur.

Issue seems to be related to  and based on the last comment and my experience it may be related to Xiaomi phones, maybe even exclusive to it. 

I was able to test it on Xiaomi Note 4, Xiaomi Redmi 5 exception occuir on both. But it doesn't with Android emulator (Oreo 8.1). Sadly I don't have any other Android phone, so I can't test anything else.

Fishing [in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16597138/loading-an-assembly-by-bytes-loses-the-location) it seems there are subtle differences between `Assembly.Load` and ` Assembly.LoadFrom`

I don't fully understand what's going on, however changing this line back makes the pipeline recognize my project again.

EDIT:
Looking a bit more carefully at #6202, I see the point is so the custom pipeline dll isn't locked by the pipeline tool, which is why Assembly.Load is used instead of Assembly.LoadFrom.
It seems the issue with Assembly.Load(byte[]) is that it can't locate the dependent libraries because it no longer knows its location of itself so the app only looks in the pipeline app's directory?
In any case, changing the code to include AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve &amp; loading dependencies:
csharp
Dictionary&lt;string, Assembly&gt; asmMap = new Dictionary&lt;string, Assembly&gt;();
var mainAsm = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies();
ResolveEventHandler resolveHandler = (object sender, ResolveEventArgs args) =&gt;
{
    asmMap.TryGetValue(args.Name, out var assembly);
    return assembly;
};
AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += resolveHandler;

foreach (var path in assemblyPaths)
{
    try
    {
        var a = Assembly.Load(File.ReadAllBytes(path));
        asmMap[a.FullName] = a;
        foreach (var childAsmName in a.GetReferencedAssemblies())
        {
            var aa = mainAsm.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.FullName == childAsmName.FullName);
            if (aa != null)
            {
                continue;
            }

            var chPath = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(path), childAsmName.Name + ".dll");
            if (!File.Exists(chPath))
            {
                continue;
            }
            var a2 = Assembly.Load(File.ReadAllBytes(chPath));
            asmMap[a2.FullName] = a2;
        }
        var types = a.GetTypes();
        ProcessTypes(types);

        var watch = new FileSystemWatcher();
        watch.Path = Path.GetDirectoryName(path);
        watch.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
        watch.Filter = Path.GetFileName(path);
        watch.Changed += (sender, e) =&gt;

I have an issue with MonoGame Pipeline Tool 3.7.0.1708 where my custom processor project is no longer accepted by the pipeline tool and it gives a "Invalid / Missing Processor" where it used to be assigned.
Doing some code digging, it looks like it occurred due to commit #6202, where the following code is throwing an exception (which is swallowed) in the file PipelineTypes.cs:
``
I'm not an expert in this area so I don't know if assuming dependent dlls being in the same folder as the desired assembly is enough (it is sufficient for my project...).

Furthermore, PropertyGridTable.Update() needed to be changed from
`drawable.Invalidate();`
to
`Application.Instance.Invoke(() =&gt; drawable.Invalidate());`
because when the file change detection occurs, it doesn't seem to be on the main UI thread and crashes the pipeline app.</Description>

Delving in the MonoGame's source code, I discovered that the `ContentReader`'s `GraphicsDevice` property is internal:

            // Should it REALLY be internal?
            internal GraphicsDevice GraphicsDevice
            {
                get
                {
                    return this.graphicsDevice;
                }
            }

It also seems that there is no other way to get a `GraphicsDevice` in a content type reader, which might be problematic to custom graphics contents (for example, a preprocessed path primitive using the Kilgard–Bolz technique). Is it the intended code? If so, how can I get a `GraphicsDevice` inside a content type reader?

When adding content in the Pipeline Tool a window appears asking if I want to copy the file or add a link to it. Sometimes this window appears off the screen. Maybe it should always appear in the same place as the Content Pipeline Tool window?

FYI, I am running a desktop resolution of 3440x1440 (21:9 aspect ratio).

I installed MonoGame 3.7 and I can't drag and drop image files in the Content Pipeline Tool on Windows anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled to see if something went wrong during the install but the problem persists. I can still add content with "Add -&gt; Existing item" and building it also works.

    <Title>Game will not close using window close button (Unique Situation)</Title>
    <CreatedDate>21/09/2018</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>14/11/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I am having an issue with the window/game freezing when clicking the window's X close button.

Hold onto your hats. I am going to try to explain this the best that I can and I am sure that the issue has to do with the way I am doing this and using **MonoGame**.  I just don't know how to fix it.

I am creating a game engine that has a **plugin type architecture**. The whole idea is that my engine will be able to load implementations of various parts of my engine, by loading a DLL library at runtime that contains those implementations.

Doing this will let me (or other developers) actually take only certain parts of my engine and swap out the implementation with another one as long as they adhere to the interfaces provided. This shared library that contains all the interfaces is in its own library.  The implementation library is another separate project.

This implementation library would be the **plugin** for the underlying core of the engine.

So the way it would work would be this.  Developer John Doe would create a C# windows project running .NET Framework 4.5.  This project is the **game** and would have a reference to my engine library for use.  John Doe would then create a C# library project using .NET Framework 4.5 under the same solution.  For this library project he would reference my **engine core** library that contains all of the interfaces that he has to adhere to for my game engine to use the new implementation library he is creating.

This implementation library is loaded during runtime by my game engine.  Throughout my engine I use a static class to pull a particular object implementation from the assembly that was loaded and inject it where its needed.


---

Example Of Usage:

I create the windows app, reference the game engine.  Create another library project called **MyImplementationA** and I reference my engine core library.  In the implementation library I just created I would create a class called **TextureA** that implements the **ITexture** interface that comes from the core library. I write my **implementation** for **TextureA**.

Now I create another implementation library project called **MyImplementationB** and reference my engine core library just like above.  But this time I create a class called **TextureB** that implements the **ITexture** interface and write its implementation.

Now I have 2 assemblies.  **MyImplementationA.dll** implements **TextureA** and **MyImplementationB.dll** implements **TextureB**.  Now at this point I can just simply load either library up and I get that particular functionality.  

Doing this means that if **DevA** wants to use **MonoGame** to do some of the work for the engine under the hood, 
and **DevB** wants to use **SDL**, it will all operate the same.  Or they can use something else if they wanted.

Now everything I explained above works like a charm.  Its pretty awesome and I am very happy with the results.

But.....my implementation that I am using for testing my game engine is MonoGame.  This means in the implementation library it uses the **Game** class.  I am only assuming that this is the cause because I technically am loading the **MonoGame** **Game** during runtime from another assembly.  Could this be the issue?  I know that it must be obviously running in the same process as my game engine, because my engine is the one loading the assembly so that means that **MonoGame** under the hood would be running in the same process as my engine.

One thing I tried to do is have my engine get access to the **Game.Exit()** method so that way I could try to exit the game and close the window in code.  This does not work.  It just throws a **System.NullReferenceException** at the line of code where **Game.Run()** is used.  This tells me that at this point **Game** has been disposed of, garbage collected, and doesn't exist anymore.  So I guess it is **"Exiting"**, but not closing the window.  And with that I think the reason the window doesn't close is because it isn't **"attached"** to **MonoGame** anymore.

I know this situation is unique and there are probably a lot of unknowns, but at this point I don't know what to do about the issue and really don't want this to prevent me from using **MonoGame** or any other libraries.

If you need more information or have some questions for me to help you understand, don't hesitate to ask.

Any help would greatly be appreciated!!

    <Description>&lt;!-- Write your issue below --&gt;
The version of the SharpDX libraries showing in the references section of the **MonoGame.Framework.WIndows** project are showing version **v4.0.1.0.**  The branches I checked the references under were **master** and **develop**.

This led me to believe that the version that is used in my project when creating a visual studio project would be the same version of **v4.0.1.0**.

I checked the version being pushed into my bin\debug folder and noticed that the versions are indeed **v2.6.3,** not **v4.0.1.0**.

Is this intentional?  I checked the installation directory where monogame for visual studio is installed and those binaries are indeed SharpDX libraries are **v2.6.3** as well.  This makes sense to me of course because I am sure that when a monogame project is built, this location is where the binaries are being pulled from when pushing into the bin\debug folder.

I was expecting the **master** branch to show **SharpDX v4.0.1.0** and the **develop** branch to possibly show a later version.  But this was not the case.

I have a windowed DirectX app. When my app is behind other windows (but not minimized) e.g. behind Visual Studio, Notepad++ etc, I still get mouse events firing when I click on other apps that are in front of it. The other apps function as normal (e.g. clicking on lines of code in the IDE in Visual Studio, but the Monogame app behind it also receives these mouse clicks and is triggering the game functionality.

I would expect the Monogame app not to receive mouse events when it no longer has focus.

I want to make a custom file importer for the Monogame Pipeline Tool. 
To allow something like this:
`System.IO.Stream file = Content.Load&lt;System.IO.Stream&gt;("myLevel");`

This will make it easier to load custom files where file access is restricted, like on the Xbox.

Is this something that will be an accepted addition to the source? 
(Im an experienced programmer, but never worked on an open source before)

    <Description>I believe PNG images that have 16 bits per channel are incorrectly processed by the content-pipeline tool. 

I've created an extremely minimal reproduction here: 

Below you see two textures rendered with the spritebatch, with default settings. The left sprite is a texture generated from an 8 bit per pixel PNG file, and is displayed correctly. The right sprite is a texture generated from the same PNG file, this time stored with 16 bits per pixel. As you can see the colors are completely different.

I am compiling a sample project in the latest version of MonoGame with plans to port over an existing XNA project. In polling the controllers that are active, I have the following code (MaxPlayers defined as 8)

    // Update previous gamepad states and store the latest state
    for(int padIndex = 0; padIndex &lt; Global.MaxPlayers; ++padIndex)
    {
      m_gamePadPrevious[padIndex] = m_gamePadCurrent[padIndex];
      m_gamePadCurrent[padIndex] = GamePad.GetState(padIndex);

      if (m_gamePadCurrent[padIndex].Buttons.A == ButtonState.Pressed)
      {
        Debug.WriteLine("Controller {0} A button pressed", padIndex);
      }
    }

This code, however, doesn't behave the same way as XNA.
XNA - Controller index 2 disconnects - Controller 2 IsConnected = false, all controllers before and after this index stay connected with IsConnected = true
MonoGame - Controller 2 disconnects - Controller 2 IsConnected = true, controllers after this index move down in the array, Controller 4 shows IsConnected = false instead.

If any controllers disconnect, the result shows the last controller as disconnected, even if any other player's controller disconnects.  This causes a huge problem with players controlling other characters.  I've tested this with 3 XBox 360 controllers and 2 XBox One controllers.

Is there an easy way to preserve the behavior that XNA provides or a code sample I can use to detect the properly assigned controller index that disconnected? I'm not seeing anything in GamePad or GamePadState that is obvious. I have 4 XBox 360 and 4 XBox One controllers to use for testing.

EDIT: I've tested this on the latest development build of MonoGame (3.7.0.1681) and the problem still occurs.

    <Title>Add interfaces for high level objects like SpriteBatch and GraphicsDeviceManager</Title>

    <Description>## Problem

Currently it is very difficult to test code which depends on certain parts of Monogame, such as `SpriteBatch` as you cannot mock the object making your tests require actual instances of SpriteBatch (which in turn requires GraphicsDeviceManager instance etc), and while there are some test classes internally in MG source they are not really exposed externally.

Due to this the only way to get around it at the moment is to create your own inherited version which tries to counter the underlying behaviour from base classes, and also use some pragmas to switch between test code and real code which is VERY bad as my source code shouldn't need to know it is being tested, and would end up with some test specific code being bundled into my actual game source.

I am also wanting to make use of Dependency Injection which is far better when using interfaces as you are able to bind interfaces to implementations far easier than binding concrete classes to themselves.

There is also the problem that because of not using interfaces a lot of internal MG code is having to use partial classes or other tricks to have platform specific code run, i.e winRT, SDL related code for `GraphicsDeviceManager`. A lot of this could be avoided if interfaces were adopted for surface API contracts and then composition used within platform specific packages to bundle the specific optimizations/required.

## Solution

Wherever possible on the surface API (ones consumers often use) add interfaces which expose the public methods/properties and use that as the contract on exposed MG code.

For example if we had `ISpriteBatch` we could mock this within a test without needing any form of underlying graphics device etc, also this would mean that we could easily provide our own implementation if needed and, this would also mean that all code depending on this only cares about the surface API contract, not the underlying implementation behavior, so if you needed to make platform specific optimizations you can do so without effecting the consumer too much, as the contract doesnt change, just the underlying implementations. 

The only down side to adding interfaces and using them as the contract around the framework would be the impact on using interface methods (akin to virtual methods) vs direct calls, which depending on throughput can create an almost non existent performance difference.

Going forward this allows users to do more with the library in varying scenarios from testing, plugins, extensibility, dependency injection etc, and makes the framework easier to chunk up and move towards a more singular `MonoGame.Core` which could contain all truly shared functionality and interfaces, and just have platform specific implementations, ultimately making it more flexible going forward.

## Other info

If you have resharper this is not too difficult to do as you can literally extract interfaces quickly for most objects, then just find all usages of that concrete class and replace it wherever needed with an interface.

If there are any performance critical internal pieces by all means skip putting interfaces in, but for surface API there is virtually no downside other than the overhead of implementing it.</Description>

Hello,

I am currently trying to add some visual tests to my game. In managed to write working tests when running independently, but I get an exception when I run all the tests together.

Here's a minimal example that exhibits the problem :
``

If I comment out the `` game.dispose()`` instruction in the ``RunSimplestGame`` method, I can run them together without error, so I suspect that something is shared between the two tests and disposed before the second one is finished.

Am I missing something? Any idea of what needs to be done to ensure that both tests are effectively independent?

Thanks

Extremely slow performance of Application.DoEvents(); (which I understand is an OS call)

It is taking about 6ms per game loop to run the message loop on a high end fully up to date windows 10 machine.

Any idea why? This didn't seem to be an issue until I moved to 3.7 from 3.5 and it only happens when I move the mouse.

    <Description>If you supply anything other than 0 to pan, it will move all sound to the right speaker.

I've tried with -1, 0, and +1;  0 works fine out of both speakers, but -1 and +1 both cause the sound to come out of the right speaker only.  (-1 should be the left speaker!)

I did some googling and it looks like other people have [run into this before]( but I didn't see a bugs logged.

The suggested workaround in that forum post is to edit the sound file and bake the panning in, but that's just ridiculous, I should be able to specify a float for dynamic sound panning, and not need 100 versions of the same sound file.

    <Description>Hello there, first and foremost thank you for all this amazing work!

Allas not everything is sunshine as I find myself in a strange situation. As the title says my MonoGame android game runs fine if launched in debug (so no optimization) from my IDE (Visual Studio 2017 v15.7.6) on my phone (SONY Xperia z5 Compact E5823 Android 7.1 - API 25) but if I launch it manually from my phone (no debugger) it is super laggy, from stable 60fps to... 5? Same if launched in release (with optimization then) and obviously no debugger, completely unplayable. The emulator runs it fine.
Is there something I have completely missed? I thought having a debugger attached would made things slower, not the contrary! Are some things leveraged to my computer when debugging which make my phone appears to run my game smoothly hiding the fact that it's a mess in reality? I am pulling my hair over this.

I tried with both stable and preview last versions 3.6.0.1625 and 3.7.0.1681-develop, same thing. My project is built against Android 8.1 API 27 with the minimum android version 7.1 API 25.
Tried it on someone else Pixel 2 phone and apparently it runs fine, but unplayable on an other one android tablet (don't now which one).

This is my setup in the Game class
``
My game is only using a SpriteBatch to draw around 650 sprites, all from the same sprite sheet so they are batched correctly together, although I am using the BackToFront mode so there is some sorting (not that changing it to Deferred made any difference...).
On .netcore MonoGame on my pc (not a beast i5-3570 cpu, 8Go ram, GeForce 660TI, Windows 10) I can push it to +48k for comparison before breaking from 60fps at 720p.
If that is important I am using C#7.0 features heavily with Span, ref return and all for my update logic if it is known to cause problem on android, not that I have found anything about that.

But yeah, it all boils down to: run fine on phone with debugger attached, unplayable otherwise :/ I don't have access to the android profiler with the community version of Visual Studio so I have no idea what is making it crap itself. Any magic checkbox I may have missed?</Description>

    <Description>I'd like to see the Quaternion struct expanded by some new helpful functions and properties, because I prefer to do certain things directly via quaternions. A few of my ideas:

- Normalized: The normalized quaternion
- Inversed: The quaternion inverse
- IsUnitQuaternion: Indicates whether the quaternion is a unit quaternion
- Vector3 ToYawPitchRoll(): converts the quaternion to (yaw-pitch-roll) angles
- Quaternion Pow(float power): pow operation for the quaternion
- Quaternion Sqrt(): square root of the quaternion
- Quaternion Log(float base): logarithm of the quaternion
- Vector3 RotateVector3(Vector3): Rotates a Vector3 by the rotation represented by the quaternion
- Matrix ToMatrix(): Converts the quaternion into a rotation matrix
etc.

I can provide the code, but is there any chance that this will make into MonoGame? If so, I would start to write the code.</Description>

Hello !

I'm using a case sensitive disk partition on my mac and it causes troubles installing the visual studio mac extension for monogame. 
Actually the installer can't find 3 files due to the folder's name not matching. This is the error I got:

&gt; /MonoDevelop.Docker/MonoDevelop.Docker.dll: The file '/Applications/Visual Studio.app/Contents/Resources/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/docker/MonoDevelop.Docker/pt-BR/MonoDevelope.Docker.resources.dll' referenced in the manifest could not be found.
&gt; /Applications/Visual Studio.app/Contents/Resources/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/docker/MonoDevelop.Docker/MonoDevelop.Docker.dll: The file '/Applications/Visual Studio.app/Contents/Resources/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/docker/MonoDevelop.Docker/zh-Hans/MonoDevelope.Docker.resources.dll' referenced in the manifest could not be found.
&gt; /Applications/Visual Studio.app/Contents/Resources/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/docker/MonoDevelop.Docker/MonoDevelop.Docker.dll: The file '/Applications/Visual Studio.app/Contents/Resources/lib/monodevelop/AddIns/docker/MonoDevelop.Docker/zh-Hant/MonoDevelope.Docker.resources.dll' referenced in the manifest could not be found.

These files exist but those folders didn't use the same case on my computer:
- pt-BR =&gt; pt-br
- zh-Hans =&gt; zh-hans
- zh-Hant  =&gt; zh-hant

So I tried to rename those with capital letters, but I got the same kind of error. This was with the same folders, but instead with the other spelling. I think, somewhere in the package (I don't know how it works exactly) these folders are spelled with 2 spelling.

As a workaround I made symlinks between:
pt-BR =&gt; pt-br,
zh-Hans =&gt; zh-hans 
zh-Hant =&gt; zh-hant

This way it works for me.

Hi,

I'm probably missing something, but I have this weird behaviour with MG :
``
returns false.

From  , it is as if it does object equality but not Vector equality.

If I test X &amp; Y explicitly, it (obviously) works.

Is there another way to test Vector2 equality?

Thx

Just tried to create a RenderTarget2D with a SurfaceFormat of Vector4 in my android Project.
This works fine in my android Emulator (running with Oreo 8.0).

On an old Galaxy Tab with Jelly Bean 4.2 it fails  with a System.NotSupportedException ("The requested SurfaceFormat `Vector4` is not supported."). That could have been expected on such an old system.

What makes me wonder is that a call to "Graphics.Adapter.QueryRenderTargetFormat()" Returns TRUE for the same set of parameters (GraphicsProfile.HiDef, SurfaceFormat.Vector4, DepthFormat.None, 1). The out-Parameter for the selected SurfaceFormat is gets set to Vector4, too.

Shouldn't QueryRenderTargetFormat return false if the SurfaceFormat is not supported?

And I read the RenderTargets should fall back to the best alternative Format if a given Format is not supported. How should I check which SurfaceFormats are supported on my device?

I'm experiencing a problem with running android projects in Monogame 3.7.0.1641. To narrow things down I have created a completely new Monogame Android through the current Visual Studio 2017 template.

In the main activity the template creates a new Game object with "var g = new Game1();". Running this code on either an Android emulator (Oreo 8.0 and 8.1 devices created with the Android Device Manager) or an my Samsung Galaxy Tab throws an Exception in the Game-Class constructor.

Exception: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.NoAudioHardwareException
Inner Exception: System.NullReferenceException
Message: "OpenAL device could not be initialized."
Source: MonoGame.Framework
Stacktrace:

The android emulators as well as the physical Samsung tablet produces sounds without problems in other apps or the OS.

Is there anything I can do to repair this problem or at least to deactivate the AudioHardwareInitialization?

Kind regards,
Matti

Hello,

following the migration from MG 3.6 official install (from  to the nuget 3.7 package using the dev channel, I now get the following runtime error:

``
With MG 3.6, it tried to load SDL2.dll explicitly. 

The MonoGame.Framework.dll.config file has not changed, and contains the usual dllmap instructions for SDL2 (dylib &amp; .so).

Any idea?

Thx

The SetVibration index doesn't work if the controller is plugged in after the game has started running.

Plug in a single control and start a game
`GamePad.SetVibration(0, 1, 1); // Gamepad 1 will vibrate`

Plug in two controllers and start a game
`GamePad.SetVibration(0, 1, 1); // Gamepad 1 will vibrate`
`GamePad.SetVibration(1, 1, 1); // Gamepad 2 will vibrate`

Plug in one controller before starting the game, plug in a second controller while the game is running
`GamePad.SetVibration(0, 1, 1); // Gamepad 1 will vibrate`
`GamePad.SetVibration(1, 1, 1); // Gamepad 1 will vibrate`

    <Description>When programmatically creating a new spritefont, the List of Kernings cannot be smaller than the character list, this is odd, since not all characters need to have kernings when working with for example windows fonts.

If the Kerning list is smaller than character list you'll get this exception :
System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: 'Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.
Parameter name: index'

I've tracked it down to this line and the lines below it :


I'm using windows' "GetKerningPairs" and how i understand it to work, is that the font has a list of kernings it will apply to a string of characters when it checks that string with the kerning list.
So each character could have multiple kernings with multiple other characters.

But the way it's in MonoGame is strange, in the SpriteFont source code we can see that each character in a new SpriteFont has to have a kerning and only one.

This is how i get the kerningpairs of a font in windows (note that it's in vb.net):

 ``
Doing it this way will give kernings where one of the two pairs appear multiple times.

With the way kernings are used in MonoGame it seems better to use Vector3.Zero in the entire kerning list otherwise you'll be limited to one pair for each character, which have made it difficult to render text intuitively with a new SpriteFont, we also have to keep in mind that spacing is still applied too.</Description>

I'm trying to loop a PCM stream (decoded from MP3 using MP3Sharp) and the loopStart and loopLength parameters do not loop the track after being decoded.

``

Instead, it just goes right past the loop point and plays the rest of the track. I know this because it gets to the end of the song, then loops around, rather than using the specified loop points.

Setting the Window title is hit or miss now when running my game in linux, I'm thinking since this unicode support was added but it may be something else. Last dev build I installed was 6 months ago before today and this was merged 20 days ago, so that's what made me think it. 

I set Window.Title = "Whatever" inside the Initialize() override, after base.Initialize() of the X:Game class. Sometimes the Window doesn't rename at all, just displaying the executable filename as if it has never been set. Other times it might say "Whatever {Random garbage}".

PROBLEMS:

INSTALLATION / UNINSTALLATION (3.6)

The uninstallation command has some syntax error when its called, and doesn't removes at all the MonoGame Framework, letting this output:


orgot package 'com.monogame.pipeline' on '/'.
/usr/local/bin/monogame-uninstall: line 11: syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
/usr/local/bin/monogame-uninstall: line 11: `fi'
bash-3.2$ pwd

In the End of installation pipeline isn't in Application's folder. 
Have to build the MonoGame. I don't find any 3.7 installer yet.
Edit: to clarify, tested in dev build (6 july), and the same issue in both things

#### Symptoms:
Each keystroke produces garbage. If you hold the key, the garbage will seem to be generated each time a repeated keystroke is reported by the OS.

#### How to reproduce:
Download the attached .NET Core 2.1 project that contains some diagnostic code: 

1. Run the project.
2. It should report no allocations per frame.
3. Press (and hold) any alphanumeric key, the program should report some allocations.

#### Possible cause:


That line creates an object each time a system's key stroke event is handled, regardless of whether the programmer actually utilizes the `Window.TextInput` event or not.

My game doesn't work on Linux anymore. The error can be reproduced with the basic MonoGame's DesktopGL template project.

The error log:
``

The build otherwise works well on Windows and OSX. Tried both on VirtualBox and on a "real" installation.

#### How to reproduce:

1. Create an empty DesktopGL project.
2. Build it on Windows using .NET's tools
3. Run it using Mono runtime (`mono Game1.exe`) on a Ubuntu 18.04 machine.

    <Description>Would it be possible to include XML schema in the MonoGame documentation for the serializable classes(including Reflection and Helpers)?

While the helper classes would need to be manually updated (include a comment to ensure changes are reflected in the documentation), the reflective serializer can utilize xsd.exe to generate the proper schema and wrap it with the appropriate tags.

I have concluded that attempting to solve #4792, the only solutions utilizing XmlReader.Create() instead of XmlTextReader, forces any solution that exists to be in exponential time.  

While I could mitigate the problems, by eliminating already read elements, I do not feel like my approach is the appropriate solution, given my solution only works for basic cases.
I am opting for option "B" to the original problem. Give the user the needed feedback to correct the situation. Instead of only informing the user the the expected element is missing;  Give the user the expected element AND a reference to the expected schema.
Even if the proper schema is not available; This would inform the user of the out-of-order elements and the opportunity to correct them, instead of only informing of the missing element.

I hope to provide a PR with this issue, to inform the user the element is out of order(already in the works), 
I also wish to return a reference the appropriate schema to be utilized when implementing the class(Hence the Issue).

Created a Sphere with `BoundingSphere Bound = new BoundingSphere(new Vector3(0, 5, 0), 1);`
and a Box with `BoundingBox BoxBound = new BoundingBox(-Vector3.One, Vector3.One);`.
When I decrease the Y-value of the Bound, `Bound.Intersects(BoxBound)` will never return True when the intersect.

`Bound.Contains(BoxBound) == ContainmentType.Intersects` on the otherhand will return true.

I'd like to build monogame so I cloned this repo, installed some apps needed, like nant, and updated xcode to 9.4 version. I ran:
`mono /Users/orlandoleite/nant-master/build/Release/NAnt.exe -D:nuget3path="/usr/local/bin/"`

I got this error about `CFBundleIdentifier` not presented at Info.plist.
I edited `MonoGame/Test/Info.plist` to:

	&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
	&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "
	&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
	&lt;dict&gt;
		&lt;key&gt;CFBundleIdentifier&lt;/key&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;com.MonoGame.MacOS&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;/dict&gt;
	&lt;/plist&gt;

_I don't think it is related to the main problem, I'm just putting here in case._

I ran again and it appears to get many files compiled but at Tests I got those errors.

    <Description>This is a critical issue.

&lt;!-- Write your issue below --&gt;

Xnb's are creating a huge amount of bloat in file sizes.
This is a jpeg.

That is the raw file size 16.77 mb for this texture.
So its basically decompressing the jpeg from its normal storage to do whatever, but not recompressing it.

![redalertxnbsarebloating](

This is basically the same as saving a 16 million length byte array on disk directly.
Pretty much looking thru my folders all my jpegs are uncompressed on disk atm as xnb's
There is basically no compression active at all not standard or anything i have old bit compression algorithm i wrote. That would compress this back better then to not at all. Im guessing this is just a bug though.

While using Pipeline Tool, I am experiencing quite often these issues:

- When switching from one asset to another, the properties become duplicated.
- If a subdirectory does not exist anymore, it signals both the parent and the subdirectory with a Warning icon, this is correct, because that way you can notice that something' wrong in a collapsed subdirectory. But when I remove the subdirectory, the parent directory remains signaled.

    <Description>Following the getting started tutorial, I get an error during build after adding some content to the content bundle.

``

It looks like it's trying to build the files into $(Project)/Content/bin/... rather than $(Project)/bin/..., etc. I'm not sure which folder is the intended behaviour.

I did some digging into the msbuild targets files, and it appears to:

1. Define the path as "bin/$Platform/Content"
2. Create that folder, relative to the project
3. Feed that specific path into MGCB.exe, who will then interpret it as relative to the Content folder.

I tried fixing this issue, but I broke everything, so I'm just going to roll back to 3.6 (I accidentally installed 3.7, but at least you got a bug report out of it!)

    <Description>Hi there,

I often run into `` used generics. But it could very well be something else since it's months old.

When it happens, it happens always during the first frame rendering. Once it rendered, if no exception has been thrown, the program works without any further exception.

It happens only while debugging from Visual Studio.

It's random, and I can't reproduce it consistently on all computers. It happens on a Surface Pro 4 (Win10, Intel GPU), on another desktop (Win8.1, NVidia GPU), but not on another one (Win8.1, ATI GPU).
It affects all our projects.

    <Description>On the MonoGame downloads page, it only lists:

MonoGame for Visual Studio (requires a 64bit version of Windows, VS2010, VS2012, VS2013 or VS2015, and the latest DirectX Runtime)

Pretty sure we stopped using 2010 - 2013 some time back.

But more importantly, it DOES NOT list Visual Studio 2017, which technically is supported in 3.6 and is the standard platform for 3.7.


Can we please get the Downloads page (and subsequent documentation) updated to include VS 2017 please!

This is a little hard to explain...

In the old monogame version - my game would copy the color from one texture to another texture. My transfer_color array was not an exact match and was oversized. Visually I would copy a section of a texture and paste it into a new texture but slide it to the top left as possible. I would essentially not set a value into rest of the array.

I used this technique to copy two different sized textures but I started the array at the same size for both.

In the newest version of monogame I get an error message stating my array isn't the correct size. Was this intended to be changed to where I need an exact array now? 

System.ArgumentException: 'elementCount is not the right size, elementCount * sizeof(T) is 266928, but data size is 66464.'

Sample code (tried to simplify my code to make it understandable outside my game):

transfer_Color = new Color[layout.Width * layout.Height];

copy_color(transfer_Color);

When working with an external DLL, intellisense requires the DLL to by accompanied with an associated XML that has all the documentation required.

Monogame Framework DLLs have all these XML correctly installed with the SDK in `C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoGame\v3.0\Assemblies\`

But MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.dll , which is intalled in `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\MonoGame\v3.0\Tools` is missing the associated `MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.xml` documentation.

It's not a critical issue, but when working with the content pipeline, it certainly helps having the docs in the intellisense.

I've added a pull request to resolve it: #6310

Strange results are happening if I don't enable .HardwareModeSwitch on Mac.

Scaling is correct only if I enable HardwareModeSwitch (mouse coordinates matches spriteBatch coordinates).   But if I avoid HardwareModeSwitch (set to false), the same resolution performs faster but the scaling is all out of whack -- mouse coordinates do not match spriteBatch coordinates.

``

Same buffer resolution, but different pros/cons.   Performance seems about 30% slower if I do a hardware mode switch on Mac.

Desired fix is to make sure that MonoGame Mac mouse coordinates + sprite batch coordinates are in sync.  

To verify if I did something wrong -- I checked scaling parameter variables and there's no way to detect how it's scaled -- it is not an exact 2:1 scaling (e.g. 1280x800 -&gt; 2560x1600) but some kind of odd 1.6 or 1.7 scaling factor as if it forgot to internally update some internal variables.   I tried the Matrix.CreateScale tricks with hardcoded values but the 'odd' values make this hard -- there's no way to detect the correct 'weird' scaling as all the querying/metrics say 1280x800.

The problem does not happen on a PC (coordinates stay in sync).  So there might be an internal scaling calculation issue.

Hello. I am new to programming and not very skilled. The problem I have faced is that when I was programming a game using visual studios and monogame i was supposed to add two .png to my monogame pipeline but somehow I accidentally added all items on my desktop. After i closed visual studios I noticed that all my files on my desktop where missing and that the game i was making was unable to start. I have tried looking for the files but I can’t seem to find them. Please help me find the missing files as they include most of my school work.

Thanks

 I upgraded MonoGame 3.6 to the current MonoGame 3.7.0.1467 and lost a valuable debugging capability: The ability to flawlessly breakpoint/debug a running MonoGame running in exclusive full screen mode.  I use 2 monitors, one primary for MonoGame exclusive full screen mode.

I have a specific application (beam racing) that requires the mandatory use of VSYNC OFF.  So I cannot use windowed mode or borderless mode.  I must debug using exclusive fullscreen (VSYNC OFF tearlines) for this stuff.  And I liked the debugging I could do in 3.6.

In MonoGame 3.7 -- as soon as I change window focus away from the exclusive full screen app to a window on a 2nd monitor (e.g. Visual Studio), the MonoGame app freezes for 1 second, followed by loss of graphics.    

Had no problem in 3.6.  Exclusive full screen mode did not make a fuss if it lost focus, as long as I focussed to a window on a separate monitor (2nd monitor) -- the exclusive fullscreen graphics simply paused when a breakpoint was hit, and I could do my usual debugging (as long as I did not move any windows to the exclusive fullscreen display).  Not anymore in 3.7, debugging is now made impossible in exclusive fullscreen ....

When trying to run my app which uses instancing on my Pixel C tablet, I get the following error:

`System.PlatformNotSupportedException: Instanced geometry drawing is not supported yet for GLES or MONOMAC.
`

However, according to these posts, instancing is supported on OpenGL ES 3.0 and higher (and 2.0, with the specific extensions).





The Pixel C supports OpenGL 3.2, so it should work there. 

I am assuming this means it's not enabled in Monogame.

cc @Jjagg @dellis1972  You guys seem to be the resident experts in OpenGL (and instancing), so giving you a heads up here...

Hi!

I'd like to discuss another possible way to initialize a game object for a XAML UWP application.

Now there is a static initializer `MonoGame.Framework.XamlGame&lt;T&gt;.Create(...)` that takes care of the construction of the `Game` class. With this logic, it isn't possible to inject in a "clear" way some dependencies, since the default constructor is called: `var game = new T();`.

What I'd like to propose as a pull request, if you agree with me, is:
- Doing nothing to XamlGame&lt;T&gt;.Create(...), in avoid breaking everything and to keep projects templates as they are
- Add an overload to that Create method that takes a "gameConstructor Func&lt;T&gt;", to be called like this:
`var game = gameConstructor();` in the Create method.

In that way, the final user will initialize its UWP implementation of the game like this:
`var game = MonoGame.Framework.XamlGame&lt;MyGameClass&gt;.Create(launchArguments, Window.Current.CoreWindow, swapChainPanel, () =&gt; new MyGameClass(dep1, dep2...));`

_Side note:_
Considering that the class requires the `T : Game` to have a default constructor, by adding this overload I ask anyway to mantain a default constructor, although it couldn't be necessary.

**Why I need to inject dependencies in my game?**
Consider I have the same Game class for different platforms. My game class needs an `IStringsProvider`, an `IAchievementsManager`, an `IStoreGateway`: I would implement those differently for each platform. To me, each specific platform will have only need to construct a new game with its correct implementations. This is a real case, I have game published for Android and for UWP with this logic.

What do you think? (If you agree I could do the pull request)
Thanks.

When using DesktopGL on Linux and Android, if you load textures from .png files (using something like: "texture = Texture2D.FromStream(...)" and the images have transparency, then the transparency from these images is ignored.

Using the MonoGame Pipeline to convert these png files to xnb files, solves the problem, so I think the issue may be linked to the way png files are loaded from streams with OpenGL.

Note: The same png files load ok on DirectX projects.

    <Description>The project templates use a hard coded guid instead of having a new one generated each time. This can cause [problems in Visual Studio for Mac]( when adding the same MonoGame project type to the same solution.

The [template.config file]( should have a guids section that lists the guids used in the templates. The templating engine will then replace these with new guids when the templates are created.

#### Overview:
Took a break from gameDev with a work trip a few weeks back and found that none of my home computers (all windows 10) and my 3 alpha testers (also windows 10) can use a GamePad.

Tried it both on 3.6 and 3.7.

The gamePad ".isConnected" is true or false depending on if the controller is plugged in or not for most of the devices, except the xbox one controllers no longer light up or say connected. So I can confirm that this isnt previously posted issues regarding false positives. For some controllers, even emulators are able to get them.

On all listed devices, however, even when the gamepad class sees them as connected, there is no input being read. I made a small input manager to check all the input and log them. Nothing from gamepads. Even doing direct GamePad state checks on all possible buttons during the update loop, I've got nothing.

Checking my reliability history, seems that there is a new Xbox Controller driver install when the controller is plugged into that system for the first time. Started showing up on 3/13.

I last worked 2/28 for me, but I am not sure when it stopped working exactly. Or if it has to do with a specific windows update. Some places are showing that Creators Update for Windows 10 is a problem. I tried getting the old drivers back, which has helped some Unity games, but still has issues with Monogame projects. All devices now show up as HID devices, rather than usb devices in my device manager.

I know we can't control Windows Updates, but this isn't the first time a windows 10 update stopped dev on all my systems input-wise. This must be the third time in the last two or three years where ALL of my dev machines and testers are knocked offline.

I was able to replicate this issue on older versions of MonoGame as well. Specifically in the games Axiom Verge and Bastion (I have yet to try newer games like Pyre). Unity games still seem to work, but I only tried a few newer ones: Hand of Fate 2 and Enter the Gungeon.

#### EDIT/UPDATE : 
- After restarting my machine with the old drivers in place, the xbox button lights up on plugin and is connected again, so all controllers listed are "connected". But none of them can read input.
- Edit 2 - Xbox Controllers now work with most AAA games (Shadows of War, Batman Arkham) and unity (Battle Chef Brigade, Hand of Fate 2) games. Still not working with MonoGame based games like: Axiom Verge , Owlboy,  Stardew Valley)</Description>

new RenderTarget2D(GraphicsDevice, 2048, 2048, false, SurfaceFormat.Single, DepthFormat.Depth24);
`</Code>
    <Description>MonoGame currently does not support `SurfaceFormat.Single` for GL ES 3.0. I opened this issue in response to a topic on the forums: 

In OpenGL ES 2.0 float textures are supported through the [`OES_texture_float`]( extension, but only in the alpha channel. Since `SurfaceFormat.Single` is defined as a float in the red channel we can't support it in GL ES 2.0.

In OpenGL ES 3.0 things work just like in OpenGL, so things should just work if MG did exactly the same thing as in DesktopGL. Currently an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown. The user reporting this issue in the forum topic mentioned the following line causes the exception:
``

We should investigate where this exception is thrown so we can prevent throwing it under OpenGL ES 3.0. The docs should mention that `SurfaceFormat.Single` is not supported for OpenGL ES 2.0.

This does raise the question if we should actually support OpenGL ES 3.0+ only features on mobile, since it's not portable. In this case it's zero-effort though, so I'm all for it :)  </Description>

            // Reference device supports 32 samples
            Assert.AreEqual(gdm.GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.MultiSampleCount, 32);
`</Code>
    <Description>I find on some of my machines the unit test `TooHighMultiSampleCountClampedToMaxSupported ` fails:



It came from  by @Jure-BB,

Specifically i get errors on this line:

``
(note the assert also should be fixed as `expected` and `actual` parameters are reversed)

In my case my reference device gets 16 and not 32.

So either:

 a) we're not setting the reference device properly.
 b) reference device can have different max multisample counts on different systems.
 c) some other weird bug.

Someone needs to do a little research on this and fix this test.

Assuming A is not true... my guess is fixing it to verify that the resulting `MultiSampleCount` is &lt; the set value might be a more robust test and covers what we're looking to verify anyway.

Also ideally we could also enable it to run on OpenGL and XNA now and not just Windows DX platforms.

This is on a Windows 10 machine with the latest develop release.  One of the other of these windows needs to be moved to fix this.

    <Description>This is a minor issue... but one we probably should support correctly.

 - Create a new empty Pipeline project.
 - Add one content item to it.
 - Build the content.
 - Undo adding the content item leaving an empty project.
 - Build content.

At the end you would expect the intermediate `.mgcontent` files and the `.xnb` to be cleaned, but they are not and still exist.

It suggests to me MGCB.exe is taking an "early out" when there are no files and fails to clean the previous content.</Description>

    <Description>Thought I'd try out the latest dev build from teamcity but am having a little build issue when using the new DesktopGL templates for VS for Mac.  Setup as follows:

MonoGame - 3.7.0.1371
OSX 10.13.3 High Sierra
Mono 5.4.1.7
VS for Mac Community 7.3.3 (build 23)

Using the template 'MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Application' and no changes made if I try and build I get:

/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/5.4.1/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5,5): Error: The OutputPath property is not set for project 'TestGLApp.Desktop.csproj'.  Please check to make sure that you have specified a valid combination of Configuration and Platform for this project.  Configuration='Debug'  Platform=''.  This error may also appear if some other project is trying to follow a project-to-project reference to this project, this project has been unloaded or is not included in the solution, and the referencing project does not build using the same or an equivalent Configuration or Platform. (TestGLApp.Desktop)

If I open the same solution in my install of the Rider IDE everything builds fine with no issues which is making me think theres something up with CS Project file, or the way the IDE's are handling it?  I've not touched any C# for 10 years so I don't know enough to help fix it (a LOT has changed, the learning curve is steep haha).  I did dabble with the CS Project file after a google around regarding the error but with no joy.

Just thought someone might know better?</Description>

Here is the download link for the Blender file that causes this issue:

The issue can also be reproduced by starting Blender, subdivide one face of the cube that exists on start-up and then save. So we can rule out that the material or extrusion is the cause of the issue.

I noticed when I subdivide the top face instead of the right face I get a different exception:

    <Description>I've verified this occurs with both versions of the standalone pipeline tool from [3.6.0.1625]( as well as the standalone installer on [this page, 3.7.0.1341](

Steps:
* Download the pipeline tool from either link
* Run the installer, click next through all prompts
* Open the Pipeline tool from /Applications
* Create a new .mgcb file
* Add a new SpriteFont Description (.spritefont)
* Save and Build

What happens:
* 3.6.0.1625 hard crashes
* 3.7.0.1341 errors out with `System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object` and some more stack trace.  (Is there a way to easily copy that stack trace from the GUI?  Right click -&gt; copy would be great.)

What should happen:
* At least one version of the Pipeline Tool for Mac from the downloads page should not fail to build the bundled SpriteFont template.

    <Description>With version 3.7.0-1245, I get the following error when attempting to load a skinned FBX model:

`An unhandled exception of type 'System.ArgumentException' occurred in mscorlib.dll An item with the same key has already been added.
`

Note, this is not a pipeline tool issue... this is loading the model at run-time (loading the generated xnb file) using the following:

`            Model model = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;("models/dude/marine");
`

When I go back to version 3.7.0-1163, this code works perfectly and there are no issues, so it looks like the problem was introduced between version 3.7.0-1163 and version 3.7.0-1245

    <Description>I need to capture the mouse cursor within game's window area to prevent accidental clicks outside of it, which gamers find very annoying when that happens.

Unfortunately, I can't find any dedicated MonoGame's functionality for that (not letting the mouse to go outside of the game window / delta-based mouse input), so I came up with a solution involving setting the mouse position to the center of the window.

Unfortunately 2, there seems to be a rare bug that causes the position reported in the mouse state to be always different than the position I set (so my cursor is always "going somewhere" without me even touching the mouse, it resets when I move the mouse again).

My operating system is Windows 10. Not sure if it happened on older Windows versions.

Here's the screenshot from Visual Studio with the watches that show the values of variables used to compute the delta. I've set this up without touching the mouse not to spoil the result. The expected behavior is that the next time I hit the breakpoint, the X value in the mouse state should be changed to the mouseMidX's value and the deltas should be 0. It doesn't happen until I move the mouse slightly, then it returns to the expected behavior. So far, the bug appears to happen randomly.



I'm not aware of any other way to do it in MonoGame, which is a shame, because that kind of mouse control is absolutely essential for 2d aiming or FPP look.</Description>

    <Description>There are so many better ways of organizing the repo without using Protobuild:
- using shared projects
- using the new csproj format + few wildcards
- using the old csproj format + few wildcards

For the first pass we would just need to generate all the .csproj files, this way we won't be changing anything for the build system, and afterwards we could slowly do modifications over time with smaller changes.

Alternatively we could make it only generate the MonoGame.Framework and MonoGame.Framework.Net projects, while everything else is made of static projects.</Description>

    <Description>Hello there,

Our Linux players recently found out a bug with SDL 2.0.5 that is messing up with keyboard inputs (e.g. it registers repeating key presses while holding a key down).

Upgrading (or downgrading to 2.0.4) proved to fix this issue.

It might be worth updating MonoGame dependencies.

On a side note, OpenAL-Soft also got updated recently with quite a bunch of changes. I haven't tested any version more recent than 1.17.2, but it may also be interesting to investigate potential improvements.</Description>

I used the FPS component from [this github repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples/master/Draw2D/FPSCounterComponent.cs) and this also confirmed my results.

I uncapped the framerate and I get 2600 fps. When I move the mouse around it dives down to 600. If I capp the framerate with `fixedtimestep = true` I get 60 fps and then when I move the mouse around it dives down to 17-40 fps.

The trace output shows the drop in FPS:

    <Description>I am currently using MG 3.7.0.1245 (pretty recent dev build) for an OpenGL project on Windows 10 using VS 2017.

On my laptop, I am setting graphics mode 1920x1080 with fullscreen *off* (GraphicsDevice.IsFullScreen = false).

1920x1080 is my Windows 10 /  laptop screen resolution.

I previously had no app.manifest file (the project settings had Manifest set to "embed manifest with default settings), however, with that setting, I was having issues with the DPI scaling on my laptop and the screen size / backbuffer.

Without the project app.manifest, setting the mode to 1920x1080 with fullscreen *off* worked fine i.e. I would get a windowed output.

However, I have since created an app.manifest file which has the dpiAware = true entry. This fixes my DPI scaling problem, however now, when I set the mode to 1920x1080 and have fullscreen set to *off*, the app still launches in fullscreen. If I change the app mode to another resolution e.g. 800x600 (which is different from my screen resolution of 1920x1080), then it displays correctly in windowed mode.

So the issue seems to be setting a mode that matches the screen resolution (in this case 1920x1080) and having dpiAware = true. When those 2 things are aligned, the fullscreen flag seems to be ignored and it sets the app to fullscreen anyways.

Unless I am mistaken, the app should always be in windowed mode when the isFullScreen flag is set to false, even if the window size matches the screen resolution.</Description>

    <ClosedDate>05/10/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>As of right now, Monogame uses conditional inclusion of source files to support multiple platforms.
`MonoGame.Framework` for exaple is compiled as a single monolithic assembly, which is different for each target platform.

To help with:
- Transitioning Monogame to .net standard for cross platform logic, since PCLs are deprecated
- Targeting .net core where posible
- Switching to using nuget for dependencies #6144 
- Reducing build times
- Maybe even get rid of protobuild, since Visual Studio for Mac uses MSBuild, and MSBuild itself is open source and available for Linux too

I propose monogame should:
- Have projects containing only cross platform logic, which would generate .net standard assemblies
- Have platform specific code in separate, platform specific projects, which would reference the cross platform assemblies via project reference
- Use the bait and switch Nuget pattern to have nuget and msbuild include the appropriate assemblies for the target platform when Monogame is included as a dependency
- Use Nuget packages' `runtime` folder and runtime IDs to package any OS dependent assemblies Monogame needs to run ([see here for details](</Description>

    <ClosedDate>07/10/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>As mentioned in PR #6146 the name of an `EffectParameter` may be different for OpenGL builds than for all others, if it's a `TextureSampler`.
But that is a problem, as @tomspilman already mentioned since the name of a parameter should be the primary way to fetch it, not the index in the `EffectParameter[]` in the `EffectParameterCollection`.

I've prepared a GitHub repo that should demonstrate this issue and can be a point where to start debugging. I've not added a .gitignore file, so everyting's in  there.


I've tested it with:
MonoGame 3.7.0.1232
MonoGame 3.7.0.960
MonoGame 3.6.0.1598
It's the same everywhere.

Disclaimer :)
Maybe I'm doing something wrong here. There are many ways to declare a `TextureSampler`, but I think the shader is alright.
It definitely is connected to the sampler declaration, since if you declare it like this:
`sampler2D FirstSampler : register(s0);` it works!
But you can't use the new notation to fetch texels and you're stuck with `tex2D`.
Sure is an option, but the bug is there nevertheless.

BTW... When passing two textures, there is some odd behavior that I have documented in this repository (including images). Maybe someone can take a look and decide whether it's worth pursuing or not.

    <Description>I have a program that uses a custom Direct3D shader/effect that works fine on Window 7 for the last year.

I'm in the process of upgrading and testing on Windows 10.

For some reason this custom shader/effect works fine on Windows 7 but not on Windows 10.

It should show an earth model with continents and shaded with a day/night shader/effect.

On Windows 7 it works fine.  On Windows 10 it just shows a black ball.

What is the difference in Windows 7 and Windows 10 that might cause shaders/effects not to work the same?

I'm pretty new at shaders/effects so it might be something obvious to someone with more experience.

It appears that some other setup is needed to build MonoGame other than just running Protobuild?

Is this documented somewhere?  I've searched documentation for a couple of days and so far I just see documentation that says run Protobuild.

    <Description>RemObjects has implement lots of languages on .Net platforms such as a Delphi-like language named Oxygene, a C#-compatible language named Hydrogene, a Swift-like language named Sliver and a Java-like language named Iodine.
I think it's worthy to make those templates while there are many developers who are more experienced in Java, Delphi or Swift than C# and VB.net, they can also make games in those languages other than C# and VB.net.
I've tried to make a MonoGame project which written in Swift, but I got stuck in make the mgcb compiled.</Description>

    <Description>I tried searching open and closed issue for SetCursor and MouseCursor and only came up with a few unrelated issues. Currently I'm using a shared project with all my code then linking this to a MonoGame DirectX and a MonoGame OpenGL project to easily support deployment to both platforms.

The issue here is that Mouse.SetCursor doesn't appear to work on DirectX, I get the standard cursor, but if I run it on the OpenGL project it works as expected. Is this a known issue?

Here is the code I'm using to set the cursor in both platforms (shared project). Constants.Scale can be replaced to 1 or 2 depending on the screen size.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm using `3.6.0.1625`

    <Description>So I'm pretty sure I've got my Monogame installed correctly because I can just do a git reset --hard and my code works just fine. 

I wanted to use the IntermediateSerializer, so I decided to download Monogame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Portable from NuGet into my project. After compiling it again, the program throws an error inside the my Game1 class, stating that the "Content" property is null.

I've trying commenting out everything related to the ContentManager inside the constructor and after putting breakpoints inside my LoadContent, Update and Draw functions, it seems that none of them are called and the program just terminates without even opening a game window.

I've tried everything, but I think this is a MonoGame issue. The error occurs after installing the package, so it's not my code's fault</Description>

    <Description>Currently the `OpenAssetImporter` is crippled to only expose features that the old XNA `FbxImporter` and `XImporter` supported.  So for example we only expose 4 different texture types in `MaterialContent`:

  - Texture (aka Diffuse)
  - Transparency
  - Specular
  - Bump

However AssImp supports like 12 different types of defined texture maps and even custom ones.

Same sort of thing exists for material properties where we only expose a few... but some useful ones like 'IsTwoSided` is not exposed.

I think we have two paths:

 A) Just add the extra stuff as `OpaqueData` and not worry.
 B) Set a `XnaCompatible` flag to `OpenAssetImporter` when called from the `FbxImporter`.

If you use the `OpenAssetImporter` or `FbxImporter` let me know what you think.</Description>

        <Description>This PR is related to 

I extended the material support in `OpenAssetImporter` to export all the material features exposed by AssImp.  This breaks anyone that uses `OpenAssetImporter` directly... but hopefully for the better.

`FbxImporter` and `XImporter` now pass a flag to `OpenAssetImporter` asking for XNA compatibility returning just the material properties expected under XNA 4.0.  I added a unit test for `FbxImporter` to help prove that nothing has changed or is broken.

It is debatable if this is necessary or if we're ok passing additional non-XNA material properties from `FbxImporter` and `XImporter` .</Description>

    <Description>In XNA it is possible to rename a content project. This would place the resulting binaries in a directory with the name of your choosing. In MonoGame you can rename the .mgcb file or rename the directory it resides in, but the msbuild system will always copy it to a directory named Content in the target directory.

Firstly this is a problem because it differs from XNA. Secondly this is a problem because you have no way to separate the target directory of multiple content projects in a single project. This can very easily lead to file name collisions.

    <Description>For games that deal with large scales, double-precision (64-bit) float support is very nice to have. 

* Many large-scale games on custom engines use `double`, such as Minecraft, Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous, Space Engineers, Grand Theft Auto, the Unigine game engine, and likely many many more. 

* Few game engines currently support `double` for legacy reasons back when CPUs weren't able to calculate `double` quickly, however, modern FPUs and SIMDs can handle double-precision without issues. Some can even use quadruple-precision at high speeds. 

* Some large scale games, like Kerbal Space Program, use `double` for math and convert back to `float` for local positioning of objects, because it uses the Unity game engine which uses single-precision floats. This isn't efficient or ideal, is difficult to program, and ends up being buggy in the end. It isn't too practical for multiplayer, either.

One way of doing this is by creating an abstract type `real_t` instead of `float` which can be `typedef` to either `float` or `double`. This is ideal because it would allow MonoGame to compile with either `float` or `double` support with minimal effort. This is how Godot is implementing it: 

It may also be worthwhile to create structs like `Vector3f` and `Vector3d` which are always `float` or `double` respectively, so that creators of games can choose a fixed type to use with their scripting.</Description>

    <Description>Please note that this is not a request for MonoGame itself to build with .NET Core or .NET Standard.

I would simply like to be able to run the command ``dotnet build MySolution.sln`` and make it work. I have a solution with some MonoGame projects, and several library projects, I wanted to convert the library projects to .NET Standard 2.0, and then build on TeamCity by using the dotnet tools. However, when I try to build even a basic MonoGame project it aborts with errors. From what I can gather, it's looking for the .targets script in a place where it isn't installed.

Tested on MonoGame v.3.5.1 and Dev Build v3.7.0.1156

    <Description>I'm trying to follow this [instruction]( but the Game1 class cannot found from the platform project.

This is how I created the projects(Xamarin Studio):
1. Created a MonoGame Shared Project and named it as "MainGame"
2. Created a MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project and named it as "MainGame.DesktopGl"
3. Deleted "Game1.cs" and "Content Folder" from "MainGame.DesktopGl"
4. From the "MainGame.DesktopGl", I added reference to "MainGame"
5. Set the Output Assembly Name of "MainGame.DesktopGl" as "MainGame"

I'm still fairly new to Xamarin Studio and never used Shared Projects before because it is not natively installed on Visual Studio and can't find any use for it in my previous projects because all of it are web applications.</Description>

    <Description>I deployed a game and sent to a couple of people so they could test. All of them was able to play the game with one exception. The game window wasn't opening, no error was being thrown. The process just starts then close. So I told him to send me the Error Viewer exception:

![](

Then I utilized this code to generate a log file to know more about the problem:

    static void CatchUnhandledException
        (object sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e)
    {
        StreamWriter sw;
        Exception ex;

        try
        {
            sw = new StreamWriter("crash.txt");
            ex = (Exception)e.ExceptionObject;

            sw.WriteLine("### Crash ###");
            sw.WriteLine(ex.Message + ex.StackTrace);
            sw.WriteLine("### Inner ###");
            sw.WriteLine(ex.InnerException);
            sw.WriteLine("### Source ###");
            sw.WriteLine(ex.Source);
            sw.WriteLine("### Data ###");
            sw.WriteLine(ex.Data);
            sw.Close();
        }
        finally
        {
        }
    }

And his results:

I've tested with several versions:

* Using MonoGame 3.6: Exception says MonoGame requires OpenGL 3.0+, but [he has 3.1](
* Using MonoGame 3.7: Exception says MonoGame requires `EXT_framebuffer_object`, but [he has it](
* Using MonoGame 3.5: **The game works**.

All the tests were done using the plain Class Platform Desktop Project, no changes, it still crashes.</Description>

    <Title>MonoGame.Utilities's Operations.Malloc is not threadsafe, and so Texture2D.FromStream isn't</Title>

    <ClosedDate>12/01/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Been suffering from random failures to load pictures into textures, which ultimately were tracked down to exceptions while trying to index the dictionary used by Operations.Malloc.

On inspecting  it became clear that there isn't any protection against concurrent writes to the dictionary tracking allocations, and so this method would be unsafe to call from multiple threads at once, but Texture2D.FromStream assumes that the image loading can be done from any thread and doesn't dispatch to the UI thread until actually creating the texture, leading to multiple calls into malloc at once during texture loading. As a temporary fix I've modified my fork to do the image loading on the UI thread too- this is not ideal but prevents crashes.

Replication is somewhat difficult- you have to spawn multiple threads and try to load textures on them, and sometimes it will crash. I could put together a sample project if needed, although I think the problem is fairly visible to inspection- there's an object called "_lock" in Operations.cs, but nothing ever uses it, and in the absence of any locking concurrent writes to a dictionary are incorrect.</Description>

    <CreatedDate>15/12/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>30/09/2018</ClosedDate>

    <Code>csharp
var win32Handle = Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainWindowHandle;  // 0x0000000000b50646
var sdlHandle = this.Window.Handle;                              // 0x0000025f1ba0ccc0
var windowType = this.Window.GetType().FullName;                 // "Microsoft.Xna.Framework.SdlGameWindow"
`</Code>
    <Description>In XNA as well as in the [`WinFormsGameForm`]( [`GameWindow.Handle`]( returns the Win32-Handle of the window.

That can be cast to a `System.Windows.Forms.Control` (of course, that's impossible as we don't use WinForms), but also passed to Win32-APIs such as `ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, int nCmdShow)` in `user32.dll`, or the linux equivalents.

However, at the moment it [returns the SDL-Handle]( which is quite useless at first glance, since one can only pass it to SDL-functions. 

Those SDL-Functions can't be used, since the [SDL Interface is not exposed]( 

Proposal:

- Change `SdlGameWindow.Handle` to return a Win32-Handle by expected. This can be retrieved using [`SDL_GetWindowWMInfo`]( and create an explicit Property `SdlGameWindow.SdlHandle` where the old `_handle` will be returned. Problem: `SdlGameWindow` is (of course) marked internal, so a user wouldn't be able to access it without reflection.

- Give users a way to call SDL-functions such as [Sdl.Show()]( so we one can use this property with copying the SDL2.cs to the game-project.

In my opionion, a mix of these approaches would be best (expose the Sdl2-Interface somehow, *and* add the extra `SdlHandle`-Property).

    <Description>I don't want to use OpenAL audio at all, so I don't think I should be required to distribute the libraries related to it.

It would be better to make me choose whether I want to initialize the MonoGame audio (and load the libs) or not. It's done in the runtime anyway, so this functionality should be easy to add (e.g. static `Game.InitializeAudio = false;` before creating the Game instance), especially that my use case isn't really isolated. I believe that many gamedevs choose FMOD or Wwise over solutions native to engines/frameworks simply because their sound designers are used to these tools.

I get that it might be a minor issue to most people, but there's no need to be forced to distribute two audio frameworks simultaneously (which is one of many reasons I don't really like Unity) and it seems to be easy to avoid in case of MonoGame. Give us more freedom :)</Description>

What am I missing?

(The Windows Store (XAML) project will create a Windows 10 Store App with XAML support, right? Or is it for the Windows 8.1 store? Because that might explain the error :) )</Description>

It happens when processing textures of 3D models. what's worse is that it doesn't happens always.... for now the only solution is to try to recompile until it works.

I published an Android game with Monogame 3.6, from the crashes reports I see:

I check my code and I cannot reproduce it, so it doesn't seem a regular error, but I'd like to fix it anyway.

Do you have any clue? Can I give you more informations?

    <Description>The Windows DirectX build is now crashing when trying to use gamepads on Windows 7. The exception is a `DllNotFoundException` for `xinput1_4.dll`.

However, XInput 1.4 is only available for Windows 8 and higher. XInput 1.3 is the highest version supported on Windows 7.

I'm guessing this is similar to issue #5986 and was caused by PR #5949 when SharpDX was updated to v4.0.1.

    <Description>I have VS2017 Community installed.
I just installed MonoGame 3.6 and was going to try one of the tutorials.
When I try to create a new project with template "MonoGame Windows Store (XAML) Project" I get an error of;

The project file 'D:\C# Projects\Game1\Game1\Game1.csproj' cannot be opened. There is a missing project subtype....

I note on the website that it doesn't mention support for VS2017 and wonder is this the issue?

I also note that in the error message there would appear to be a reference to a Game1 subfolder inside another Game1 folder which seems incorrect.

Are there other dependencies that I need to install or do I need to work with an earlier version of VS?</Description>

    <Description>I posted on the MonoGame community about what could (maybe) be a bug on loading Song files from the content manager. 

Link to post here: 

The load function for "Song" is looking in the root of my drive for the sound file, instead of root of the "Content" directory.  This only happens with the project on my S: drive.  If I move the project to the C: drive there is no issue, it loads the Song just like the shader and image files.
The "Build Action" is set to "Build" and is using the "Ogg Importer - MonoGame".  Processor is set to "Song - MonoGame"

I am using the default cross-platform template with MonoGame 3.6.0.1625 on Windows 7 x64 with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.   Code and exception output are below.  Apologies if I have omitted something important.

The constructor code of the class that inherites from the  "Game" class.

    <Description>On Windows 10, the pipeline tool can no longer open any mgcb files. When attempting to open, an error occurs stating that there was an unknown argument "workingDir."

This happens even when the pipeline tool is run with no command line arguments, and even when workingDir is not set in the mgcb file.

 #6056 appears to be the cause of the error. It did not appear in builds before this.</Description>

    <Description>Hello, i've been using monogame core since its release and when i set the images to "Build" and try to use the "dotnet run" command, there is an error with the mgcb.exe. So i set the images to "Copy" and it was missing the .xnb files.
The only fix i found was to build the .xnb files with the stable monogame on Visual Studio 2017 and then to move the .xnb it generates to the targeted directory.
Is there any way to have the .xnb without having to build them with the OG Monogame ?

    <Title>Leveraging C# 7.2 'reference semantics with value types' in future?</Title>
    <CreatedDate>16/11/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>30/09/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Based on my shallow understanding it should be a good little performance booster? I was wondering if it's worth tracking this for some 4.x+ release. Obviously it would limit code to C# 7.2+ compilers.



&gt; An advantage to using value types is that they often avoid heap allocations. The corresponding disadvantage is that they are copied by value. This tradeoff makes it harder to optimize algorithms that operate on large amounts of data. New language features in C# 7.2 provide mechanisms that enable pass-by-reference semantics with value types. If you use these features wisely you can minimize both allocations and copy operations. This article explores those new features.

&gt; These enhancements to the C# language are designed for performance critical algorithms where memory allocations can be critical to achieving the necessary performance. You may find that you don't often use these features in the code you write. </Description>

    <Description>Hi,

with the latest build where UWP is working (900), I create a new Monogame UWP project and add the following functions to Game1.cs:

``


Run the project with F5, wait until the window is opened, and then close it. The debug output shows this:

---&gt;OnActivated
---&gt;OnDeactivated
---&gt;OnActivated

(not only OnActivated is called after deactivation and closing, but OnExiting is not being called)

edit: I'm aware OnExiting is complex in the UWP, but what is really killing me is the extra activation, as I'm deleting some tombstone files and then the 'game continue' is lost because there's never another deactivation.

    <Description>I tried to install MonoGame for Visual Studio on Windows 10 from a "standard user", which means that, after asking for the Administrator's password, Windows runs it as the Administrator user.

When this happens, of course the start menu entries get saved into the Administrator's start menu and the VS templates are not saved anywhere because the installer looks for the VS directory in the user's Documents folder, and Administrator does not have that directory, so the VS installation is not detected. I've tried with VS 2017 (and yes, with the latest 3.7.0 dev package), don't know if it's the same with older versions.

So, it seems that the MonoGame installer requires to be run by a user who is in the Administrators group.</Description>

    <Description>Slight mouse Issue here on MG 3.7, latest build, desktopGL, linux.

On game startup, windowed, I force the mouse position at the center of the game window using **Mouse.SetPosition()**.
The mouse pointer is showing at the right place.
However, **Mouse.GetState()** is never giving the forced position, but only the mouse position that was used before SetPosition().

Interestingly enough, I don't move the mouse manually at all during this process.
If I move the mouse, then the Mouse.GetState() has a more correct value. However it is still not the latest position mouse, enforced by SetPosition.

Broad blind guess, the SetPosition method is not triggering a state refresh.

    <Description>I am trying to implement the pixelated/retro look in a small project. From what I've read, I have to disable texture filtering to get the pixelated look. Therefore, I used the following approaches:
1. Referred SamplerState.PointClamp in the spriteBatch.begin method and
2. Directly assigned the SamplerState in the draw() method using;
this.GraphicsDevice.SamplerStates[0] = SamplerState.PointClamp;

Both approaches fail when I view my output in fullscreen. The tile I am drawing appears very blurry.
I have attached a zip containing my project.

    <Description>Hello there,

I'm running into texture corruption issues.

For reference: 

A few facts:
- it's random, it can happen on all iOS devices, but sometimes it doesn't (90% repro chance)
- the first few rows of the texture are corrupted
- it's not happening on other platforms
- it's not happening when using texture compression
- it's not related to the pipeline processing of the assets, it's a runtime problem
- it may be related to loading textures from a thread
- it's urgent ^^'

Does anyone have a clue about this?

    <Description>Trying to track down an [issue with my engine]( A user was noting that the window fails to close on Linux and Windows. Through testing he can get the window to close if **soft_oal.dll** is removed on the windows machine. On linux, he cannot get it to close properly. 

Can anyone help investigate? Here is [his original project]( which seems more tuned for linux. I've tweaked it for windows [(download it here)]( if someone wants to try and debug in Visual Studio.

Originally I was able to run the exe without the debugger attached and the window would close. However, that doesn't seem to happen anymore and no matter what, I get a hang. If I delete soft_oal.dll the exe and debugger work as expected. (Although it takes too long for the window to close, it does in a few seconds)

    <ClosedDate>26/09/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Towards the end of #4796 the [idea was broached]( of integrating content management into the IDE itself rather than having a separate tool, but the conversation was muddied since the original issue was essentially a complaint about the existence of a content pipeline in the first place.

The thing that strikes me about that proposition is it's essentially how XNA worked - within your XNA project you had a Content project (similar to but not the same as the MonoGame setup, where the Content folder contains a magic file called Content.mgcb) to which you added your assets directly; the conversion to XNB files happened at compile-time, and the Visual Studio properties pane let you configure the same things as the Pipeline Tool's properties pane.

Is the separate tool just for the benefit of users on non-Windows platforms, or are there benefits to having a separate tool for everyone? Is it possible to have the convenient Visual Studio-integrated content pipeline on those platforms which support it and the separate MonoGame tool elsewhere?</Description>

    <Description>**Bug**
If GraphicsDevice.ScissorRectangle is combined with GraphicsDevice.Viewport, the resulting area of the screen which is drawn does not match the expected intersection. Furthermore, the portion of the screen does not match the portion of the screen drawn when the code is executed in Microsoft XNA 4.0 (PC).

**Code**
Here is code to reproduce the bug:

Solution seems to manually move the file to the parent folder.

    <Code>GraphicsDevice.Viewport issues when using fullscreen or immersive mode.

It seems that the viewport is too small and offset'd by the size of the action bar.

This is because the initial Viewport size is based on CurrentDisplayMode, which uses AndroidGameView.GameView.Width / Height, while PreferredBackbufferWidth / Height gets their value from ClientBounds (set from Context.Resources.DisplayMetrics).

On my device, AndroidGameView.GameView is 600x1024 while Context.Resources.DisplayMetrics is 600x976.

I believe this is due to MonoAndroidGameView being created after the Context is queried for the display size and then returns values for non-fullscreen mode. Potential fix would be to initialize ClientBounds`</Code>
    <Description>Since #5410, I am running into `` after the view is created and using its size instead of the display metrics.

    <Description>(still not really sure this is a bug, but)
I wrote a simple class, serialized it using the IntermediateSerializer, and then attempted to load it with the Content Pipeline tool.  But, every time I do, it gives the error
`EXEC : warning : Unable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions property for more information.`

I have a reference to my game's debug DLL, so it should be capable of finding that.  The class is really freakin' basic - literally two strings, a vector2 and a List of ints (plus a private List of its own type, but that doesn't get serialized) and yet it says it can't find one of the types.  I even tried adding the Monogame.Framework and System dlls as references to the pipeline, in case it was being stupid, but no dice.

More details on the [forum thread]( if you need them.

    <Description>Hello,

My Android game crashes when "Do not keep activites" option is selected in developer options. Steps to reproduce:

1. Select "Do not keep activities" in developer options
2. Launch game
3. Press home button
4. Resume game

Notice that activity is recreated and so on MonoGame framework will be reinitialized. Game.Intiialize() will be called for the second time, I have some singletons initialization there which were initialized on first Game.Intialize() call. Where should I dispose singletons in such case ? I think UnloadContent(..) callback is not called in this scenario.

Texture2D uiatlas = Texture2D.FromUri(graphicsDevice,new System.Uri("Content/ui/uiatlas.png",System.UriKind.Relative);
`</Code>
    <Description>Song.FromUri is a very nice and easy way to load a music file directly from a specified path, without worrying of all glue code you'd need to put if you'd wanted to load it from stream. Could similar method be added for other types of resources such as Texture2D, SoundEffect, etc.? Basically everywhere the developer may want to load it from specific path. This would make things easy when you want to make highly moddable game that can be modded without using any sort of XNB stripper/editor.

I immediately try to Create a new Monogame project -- and I accidentally selected the VB.NET version without realizing it (instead of C#) -- but I figured, what the heck, let's give this a try.

    <Description>Just going to jump right into it.

I have my GPU set to "Enable G-SYNC for windowed and full screen mode.".

I just ran my game, and it was noticeably slower, with no change on the frame rate.

Below is a video of both:


Left - this is without G-SYNC
Right - this is with G-SYNC

Now I must say - I'm not trying to make my game "G-SYNC" compatible, but I'm worried that if I were to release the game, those with G-SYNC enabled may have issues, and not know why.

I'm just wondering if this is actually a bug, or am I missing something?</Description>

    <Description>*Rectangle.IsEmpty* and *Rectangle.Empty* should be corrected, as using either of these could lead to bugs via false negatives.

The current implementation is:
``
I realize this is legacy dragged along from XNA but regardless, its still incorrect and bugged against what should be expected behavior.

This also applies to the *Rectangle.Empty* constant which really shouldn't be labeled the definitive state of an empty Rectangle. As mentioned above, the X and Y positions have no context in whether it is empty and only a width **or** height of 0 indicate emptiness. Removing or renaming the *Rectangle.Empty* constant could be a breaking change to anyone compiled against it to determine emptiness in their code which sucks but if they're depending on this being the only form of an empty rectangle possible than their code is already bugged.

Any chance on a pull request to correct this or any thoughts against a PR for this?</Description>

    <Description>Hi there, I'm having some trouble using `Effect` on some Android devices.  
I'll try to be understandable (feel free to ask stuff if I'm not).  

My tests are performed on two devices: Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android 5.0.1) and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (Android 6.0.1). I should note that I'm using other 6.0.1 devices without any issue.  
Galaxy S4 screenshots will be on the left and Galaxy Tab 2 on the right.

Everything is built through MonoGame Pipeline 3.5

---

**1rst test**: using a shader which outputs red pixels to draw on screen
``
From now on (and no matter if I do something with `this.fade` or not), here's what kind of stuff is drawn on the Galaxy Tab 2 screen (no issue on the other device).

![screenshot_20170721-154119](

And then, every single thing I draw on screen is broken (left picture is for comparison).
![screen](

I am not that experienced with shaders so... Am I doing everything wrong? Is this somehow understandable?

    <Description>I've did a fork [here]( to upgrade monogame to SharpDX 4.0.1 #3794 , but it's failing to compile on Windows 8 project because SharpDX has removed support for it. So I pulled back my PR.

Prior trying to upgrade to SharpDX 4.0.1 , Windows 8 platform support needs to be removed. I guess this is a hairy issue, so I leave it here for people to decide what to do with this platform.

Notice that keeping Windows8 support implies not being able to upgrade to newer versions of SharpDX.

    <ClosedDate>11/07/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Currently the `GameWindow` class expose a `TextInput` event to allows the creation of text boxes and other similar UI events. However, this event only fires when characters are typed, **and common function buttons like backspace or delete don't trigger this event**.

To provide full functionality to a textbox like UI control, **we currently need to emulate the behavior** by checking the key state in the `Keyboard` class, in an `Update()` loop. However, this emulation is not perfect, because even if implement it to emulate the keyboard delays and repeat speed, if the user hit rapidly the backspace stroke (for example), as the update loop is running, by default, at 60hz, **we may miss some keystrokes**.

**This gives the end user a laggy experience**. I suggest to implement the `KeyDown` and `KeyUp` events as well (and from what I see in `OpenTKGameWindow`, they're already used, it's just a matter of exposing them) in the `GameWindow` so the user of the framework could have a finer grained control of the keyboard, and would not have to rely on sort of emulation to provide erasing capabilities to a text box.</Description>

    <Description>
I used to work on a computer running Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, but I recently made a new computer and installed Visual Studio 2017. 
I imported my MonoGame project, and the first thing I saw when I started the project, was that my font wasn't correctly displayed. The code gives different values for SpriteFont.Measurestring().Y.

I did some research on multiple computers and found this:

**computer 1:**

CPU: intel core i7-7700K, 4.20GHz
Memory: Gskill trident Z DDR4 4x8GB
Motherboard: Asus maximus ix formula
GPU: ZOTAC GTX 1080ti amp extreme (**Nvidia**)
resolution: 1920 x 1080
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").Y` : **44** 
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").X` : 8

**computer 2:**

CPU: intel core i7-4790S, 3.20GHz
Memory: Samsung DDR3 8GB
Motherboard: Hewlett-Packard 2AF7
GPU: **AMD** R7 240
resolution: 1920 x 1080
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").Y` : **32**
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").X` : 8

**computer 3:**

CPU: intel core i7-4770
Memory: Nanya DDR3 2x8GB
Motherboard: Medion MS-7848
GPU: **Nvidia** GTX 760
resolution: 1920 x 1080
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").Y` : **44**
`SpriteFont.MeasureString(".").X` : 8

Nvidia and AMD cards use a different font height. Computer 1 &amp; 3 have Nvidia GPU's and they have the same font size. The computer with the AMD card does not.

My font:  

**UPDATE**
I can't recreate this bug in a new project, but I have another project where the same bug is present.

    <Description>It seems, for some reason, that `BasicEffect` is behaving differently when looping on each `Techniques` and using the `CurrentTechnique` property. The following code shows the problem:

``

Using `CurrentTechnique` is giving the expected result, but looping each `Techniques` renders the triangle black. What I find weird is that `BasicEffect` is just holding one technique, so the loop is only on one element, the technique named `"BasicEffect"`.

    <Description>Hi,

I'm getting an error when building a SpriteFont in the Content Pipeline tool on Linux.

I do not experience the same error when using the tool on Windows.

I think this is the same error as issue #4156, as adding a .ttf file of the font with the same name to the target directory fixed the error. However, I still feel that this is a bug as this issue was supposedly fixed with #4496.

    <Description>Some GPUs support DirectX 10_0 feature level, but don't support all 9_x feature levels.

In my case, a laptop GPU supports only 10_0 &amp; 9_1 (no 9_2 &amp; 9_3).
Shaders that use ps_4_0_level_9_3 will crash on that laptop when using _Reach_ GraphicsProfile. 
They work with other GPUs under Reach and they work on this laptop when using HiDef profile.

Problem is that MG tries to make a device with feature level 9_3 first when GraphicsProfile is set to Reach. When that fails 9_1 device is created, although 10_0 is supported. This results in crash when trying to use 9_3 shaders.

Proposed solution by @Jjagg is that MonoGame should always try to create a device with the highest possible feature level to prevent this issue. Even under Reach.</Description>

    <Description>I tried to make a thread for this on the community forums, but no amount of finagling with the title got me through the title filter :frowning_face:

I'm trying to start up a barebones MonoGame project in JetBrains Rider, because MonoDevelop was giving me a headache. Just a really basic, "open a cornflower blue window" project to get started with. The code is lifted from  only the name of the game has changed.

Tutorials for working with MonoGame in Ubuntu are basically nonexistent, but I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 and have installed MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL v3.6.0.1625 as well as MonoGame.Content.Builder v3.6.0.1 through NuGet.

But running just gives me this error. It seems the `System.EntryPointNotFoundException` is coming from the GraphicsDevice and is showing up in my debugger even before I call `_graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this)`.

Could it be an issue with my graphics card or driver? I've got a GTX 1060 and I'm running the nvidia 375.66 linux driver which should have OpenGL 4 support. So I'm a little puzzled.

    <Description>The video player really needs a way to set position. 
It should have that, as it is standard functionality for a video player.

Additionally... 

It seems that some video's wouldn't play even after being processed thru the pipeline. Ill get a null texture returned over and over for some videos. 

However using ffmpeg thru the command line i have been testing re-encoding videos to get them to play. Pretty much most videos that i have re-encoded thru ffmpeg seem to work after the pipline processes them. (_Many that didn't prior to being re-encoded i.e. just built by the pipeline.)_

This is the ffmpeg re-encoding command that seems to work the best for preproccessing mp4s before adding them to the content pipeline. 

"ffmpeg -y -i" + " " + inputFilePath + " "
**"-c:v libx264 -profile:v main -level:v 3.0 -ab 128k -vf fps=30 -s 320x240 -c:a copy"** 
" " + outputFilePath

What the major criteria is for it to work or not i cant seem to pinpoint. Im thinking its the bitrate but i dunno.
If anyone  can shed some light on what the preferred encoding is for video's it would be much appreciated.

    <Description>My setup is the following:

I have a MonoGame solution containing a game project, and a content pipeline extension project. The content pipeline extension project is referenced as an external dependency in `Content.mgcb`.

When the `pipeline.exe` tool is opened, I can not build the project, as it seems that the tool keeps a reference to the content pipeline extension dll, and Visual Studio fails to overwrite the content pipeline dll.

Would it be possible to read the new importers / processors from the library, cache it in the tool and then release the dll? A nice feature would be to add some kind of "watcher" that checks if the dll has changed and reload the list of importers and processors...</Description>

    <Description>From the [MGCB.exe documentation]( the command line tool supports a `/launchdebugger` option parameter to allows debugging of custom pipeline. However, when I add this option in the `Content.mgcb`:

The pipeline tool reports the following issue `Content.mgcb: Unknown option 'launchdebugger'` and refuses to load the content file.

Currently, I circumvented the problem by adding the option `/launchdebugger` to the `MonoGame.Content.Builder.targets` file, after the `/quiet` option, but it would be cool to support the option directly in the pipeline tool.

    <Description>Currently the content of MGCB files is unsorted.  The content files appear in the file as they exist in memory.  New stuff is added at the end and the order from opening an existing file is preserved.

This seemed like a good idea when I first wrote the code, but it completely stinks for merging .mgcb files or when working with multiple people.

If we do a simple sort in `PipelineProjectParser.SaveProject`:
``

This works at the content is always in a consistent order when saving, it reduces merge conflicts, and makes it easier to compare changes.

The bad part in the code above is that a simple `OrderBy` string sort for a file path produces weird results.  There is a .NET Fiddle example here:   

If someone can come up with a good sort this would make for a great PR.

    <Description>In upgrading the ZiggyWare blog posts, I came across the good old Texture2D.FromFile method.

I know this was a XNA 1 artifact but this seems a much easier function for users not using the content pipeline to use that the current Texture2D.FromStream

Any reasons why we couldn't add such a method ?

This would simply wrap the existing FromStream function to actually load the texture from a stream safely and return the resultant Texture2D.</Description>

    <Description>The video player starts then stops then restarts fine.
I can pause it and then stop it, then, hit play again and it still works. 
However, i can't pause then, resume it, because it throws a error.

This on windows7 using the desktop gl solution.

&gt; // An unhandled exception of type 'SharpDX.SharpDXException' occurred in SharpDX.dll
&gt;                     // Additional information: HRESULT: [0x80004003], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_POINTER/Invalid pointer], Message: **Invalid pointer**

In addition it maybe leaking memory at least there are garbage collections occuring.
About 128 kb per second in my test run, with a heartbeat of about 8 kb's of garbage per second.

Here is my console output of a test run.

&gt; clicked boxinbox_C0-(PlayVideo) No children, OnClick: Action will fire
&gt; &gt;PlayVideo&lt; status StoppedVideo, State:: Stopped
&gt; 
&gt; clicked boxinbox_C1-(PauseVideo) No children, OnClick: Action will fire

&gt; 
&gt; clicked boxinbox_C0-(**PlayVideo**) No children, OnClick: Action will fire
&gt; &gt;PlayVideo&lt; **status PausedVideo, State:: Paused**

this last command is actually Play or Resume its Resume() in this case and it always throws the error.

    <Description>I created a new MonoGame.Windows (SharpDx) project,  loaded "blast_mono.wav" into a SounfEffect, and when trying to play the sound, I only get silence.

Same example in WindowsGL works correctly.

After some research, I found that SharpDX.XAudio2 [constructor]( was throwing an exception with the following message:

`HRESULT: [0x80040154], Module: [Unknown], ApiCode: [Unknown/Unknown], Message: Unregistered Class`

I tried to find a solution using the SharpDX currently used by monogame without success.

Then I followed the next steps:

I upgraded MonoGame.Framework.Windows to SharpDx 4.0
Upon compiling it gave 3 or 4 errors very easy to fix (RawBool instead of Bool and a missing argument in Reberb)
After compiling and running again, it gives more initialization exceptions, but this time in the [MasteringVoice]( , apparently, it doesn't like being passed a deviceID = 0
I removed the last three arguments, and left the constructor as `new MasteringVoice(Device);`

Compiled again, and it worked!, sound was playing!

So in order to fix the problem, it's a matter of upgrading to SharpDX 4.0  and adjusting the MasteringVoice constructor.

Btw, I tried removing deviceId argument from MasteringVolume with SharpDX 2.6.3 but it didn't work. Given that SharpDX 4.0 is a significant milestone and it seems there's no big hurdles upgrading monogame to SharpDX, I would ask to consider upgrading soon.</Description>

    <Description>My project was building before but now with a fresh Windows install, there is a problem cropping up:

I have a fresh Windows 10 Creator's Update install with a fresh Visual Studio 2017 install + MonoGame 3.6

I am getting the same type of error as:


**System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'freetype6.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)**

Even though the file freetype6.dll is there (in the same folder as MGCB.exe)

Several solutions (in 2 places online) say this error is solved by installing the VC++ 2012 Redistributable. 
 However, Microsoft has permanently removed VC++ Redistributable 2012 from their website, which eliminates my ability to fix this error.

It seems that it appears there is a problem with MGCB building with SpriteFonts on a clean Windows 10 Creators Update install (reformat from scratch) with a clean Visual Studio 2017 install (Community Edition).   This system is quite clean of VC++ 2012 redistributable files as a result (few software packages installed except latest dev tools).  For a long time, a hell lot of developer tools installed the 2012 redistributables. so it did not matter, but now it's 2017, and it appears, for the first time, none of my software packages installed the 2012 redistributables .....and it's also gone from Microsoft's website. As a result, forces me into a Catch-22.

When I try to download [Microsoft VC++ 2012 Redistributable](
Or from any microsoft links via Google, Microsoft says:

    <Description>I've been having issues loading a `Song` resource on macOS, using the content pipeline. I have tried using several different source audio and types (`wav`, `ogg`, `mp3`), different qualities (`Low`, `Medium`, `Best`), different platforms (`DesktopGL`, `MacOSX`), and last but not least, different MonoGame versions (`3.6.0.1625` and develop branch `3.7.0.379`).

The issue stems from the [PlatformLoadAudioStream#L71-L94]( method. The `audiodata` variable itself seems to contain the correct content, judging by its size and that it contains the magic cookie for `m4a` format (the converted file from the pipeline).

The `AudioFileStream` object though, is completely blank with only `LastError` set to `DataUnavailable`.

&lt;img src=" align="left" width="200" &gt;

When the properties from the `afs` object are used, the code throws a [`DivideByZeroException`]( since the sample rate, bits per channel, channels per frame etc are all set to `0` / `null`.

Further investigation shows that the `DataUnavailable` error is directly mapped to [`kAudioFileStreamError_DataUnavailable`]( with the description:

&gt; The amount of data provided to the parser was insufficient to produce any result.

This is where I got stuck, since the `audiodata` is correct from what I can tell (e.g the size is `973820`, same as the file on disk, it has the magic cookie etc). Is there anyone else experiencing this or can aid me in my debugging?

- Running on macOS 10.12.4, MonoGame `3.7.0.379`.
- The generated `m4a` file can be played with every media player I have tried.</Description>

    <Description>Going by the description, the MonoGame.Framework.Portable nuget package should be a bait and switch PCL, however it does not have the same API surface as the platform specific ones, and as a matter of fact is not a bait and switch PCL at all (look at MonoGame\NuGetPackages\MonoGame.Framework.Portable.nuspec and the only target is the PCL platform moniker - nuget packages targeting multiple platforms should be structured [like this](
This includes the latest prerelease version as well.

To test, create a monogame project (I am using the Monogame UWP template), and a PCL project, then reference the PCL from the main project.

Add the MonoGame.Framework.Portable package to the PCL project and try to build: you'll get a conflict because both the PCL nuget package and the UWP try to copy their different versions of Monogame.Framework.dll to the same location.

Try adding the PCL nuget to both projects instead of the platform specific one and MonoGame.Framework is not present anymore.

This means the only way of sharing code in a game targeting different platforms is to use a shared project like in the template, which is not at all good practice.</Description>

    <Description>I just noticed that `` is an extension method only present since .Net 4.5.

This change breaks the compatibility with .Net 4.0: 

Having a .Net 4.0 compatibility is interesting for Windows XP support.

According to the Steam hardware survey, Windows XP still represents about 1% of players. 

Is this something we should care about or should we move forward?

I would be fine with moving forward, since Microsoft doesn't support the OS anymore and that the OpenGL 3.0 requirement for DesktopGL represents a way bigger barrier (most XP machines don't even support it anyway).

    <Description>Could anyone with a windows touchscreen say if latest MonoGame Windows version is working correctly for touch?

For me, the touches collection provided by TouchPanel.GetState(); 
returns a collection that keeps accruing more touches in it as a game session goes on.
It looks like old touches are never removed.

I tried applying the fixes from here:

But that did not fix it for me. 

I'm using a modified version of MonoGame but one  which incorporates all the recent commits.
So I'm wondering if this is just broken in our branch, or is this not working for everyone?

    <Description>I was gonna talk about this in #3831 but that become too crowded.... anyway, right now DesktopGL is still split into WindowsGL and Linux projects, while we only use binaries from one of those and package it into DesktopGL stuff. Right now there are 4 possibilities, either we:
 1. Merge the projects into one, tho that might create a bit of problem for the Pipeline Tool since it resides in main platform projects
 2. Keep stuff as they are
 3. Add a DesktopGL platform, use it for NuGet and keep the rest as is
 4. Add a DesktopGL and MacGL platforms to source, add WindowsGL, MacGL, LinuxGL nuget packages and make sure that each platforms package only provides the needed native libs for that platform (bonus we can hardcode libs so there is no config file, solves 1 of the problems we have for .net core support)

I don't have any references to QuickTime in my project, so I assume this comes from a MonoGame dependency?

I'm using the MonoGame DesktopGL framework with native references to sdl2 and openal.

If this is a MonoGame issue, some guidance as to how to build a game that can pass the Mac App Store submission criteria would be appreciated.

    <Description>It seems like the default GraphicsProfile is set to Reach now instead of HiDef. Which is fine, but because I didn't know this I tried to load an SM5.0-Effect with the Reach-Profile and got the following exception:

&gt; SharpDX.SharpDXException: "HRESULT: [0x80070057], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_INVALIDARG/Invalid &gt; Arguments], Message: Falscher Parameter.
&gt; 
&gt; "

This exception is thrown in the "CreatePixelShader"-Function of the "Shader"-Class and because this exception isn't really helpful I think that:

- The Pipeline-Tool should throw an error if someone tries to compile an effect with SM4.0 (or higher) when the GraphicsProfile is set to Reach.
- MonoGame should throw an exception that tells the user to either use the HiDef-Profile or compile his effect with SM4.0-level 9.3</Description>

    <Description>Hi
I have noticed since the build 313 that the tools displays incorrectly folders (Windows7 x64, I have no other OS to test with right now):
- The + has vanished when a folder can be expanded.
- The content of 2 folders at the same level cannot be expanded
- Files in an expanded folder are not always indented in the folder (same vertical line as the containing folder) (1st screenshot: basicscene should be indented to appear in the "Scene" folder)
- Folders too (for ex, 3rd screenshot, the folder space is in "modelsB")
- The scrollbar on the right cannot be used (2nd screenshot)

    <Description>I've seen this on other projects on gihub and I think it could help encourage contribution to the project. At least that is the case for me.
I would be interested in contributing to MonoGame but since my C#-Skills are still a bit limited and so is my time. It would be helpful if I could more easily identify issues that require less knowledge of MonoGame.

A label like "beginner friedly" or "for beginners" could very much help with that. As it stands now I woud have to scan through all the issues (at least the ones with "help wanted") and then start looking at the corresponding postitions in the code. If I'm lucky I might find something that I feel comfortable working on, if I'm not I have to start that process over. And all of that takes some time.

Working in issues that require less initial knowledge could also help increase my knowledge of C# and MonoGame in general so over time it would be possible to tackle bigger problems. 

edit: I should propbably add that I'm not really used to working with labels myself, so if this is actually a thing with the people creating issues then it would be nice if use of such a label, where appropriate, would be encouraged.</Description>

    <Description>So my situation is as follows:  
Code primarily on my desktop, VS2017 Community with MonoGame 3.6.0.1625. Everything builds and runs as expected.  
I am now trying to code on my laptop, Identical setup. VS2017 Community with MonoGame 3.6.0.1625. The code is pulled straight from github, compiled(With 0 errors) and then run, The exception is thrown before the game launches. The only difference is Windows version, My desktop has the creators update and my laptop doesnt. That shouldnt affect it though AFAIK.    
Any thoughts why this is happening and how I can fix it?</Description>

    <Title>Pipeline Tool file linking</Title>
    <CreatedDate>16/04/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>29/09/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hello,

I've been patching the Pipeline tool to accept linked files. 


Some notes:

* The patch includes @vchelaru 's PR to support links in MGCB   with the addition of links to 'copied' files, which were missing (I'm so lame at git that I had to copy them manually to my repository)
* When deleting linked files, "LINKED TO" appears in the delete list to show they're linked files. There is surely a better way.
* To mimic Visual Studio links, when using "Alt" key to drag/drop files, no confirmation is required and "Link" is selected, as well as applyToAll.
* To mimic VS, when adding links that are not included in the project (because they already are included) a message box is shown. (In VS it appears in the log, but I didn't find a log to include it, and it was very confusing when files were not added without apparent reason). The message does not appear when copying (unless I messed up)


Unfortunately using git when other human users are around is too much for an old git like me (pun intended) and I've set up a project and uploaded all the changes there (that's the most I can do in git without spending an hour looking at documentation).
Here it is:     (I don't even know if this is the link I should be posting XD ) 

It also mixes several different features in a single PR, which shouldn't be done, and some variable names might not be congruent with the coding style of the project. Not even mentioning tabs and spaces and formatting :)

Finally, I have no idea at all of the Pipeline tool, so some pieces of code are more a dirty hack than a nice piece for a PR. I just hope the repository is useful to somebody with more Pipeline tool knowledge to integrate it. On the bright side I've overcommented some parts to give the 'integrator' a clue of what I'm doing :)




Missing features I haven't been able to figure out:
* When deleting a linked file, the tree is not updated (I spent hours trying to figure why, so I left it blank). When deleting folders it is OK.  It is very annoying (do you have any clue, @cra0zy ? )
* Icons should have a "link" icon when linking.
* To mimic Visual Studio links, deleting a bunch of linked files should show no delete confirmation.
* The linking system is a bit sensitive when it founds '\\' instead of '/', which shouldn't appear unless you edit the mgcb manually. I suppose the fix to this problem should be when loading the file from disk, so I decided not to touch that.
* Renaming linked assets do not work (it's easily doable but I don't know if it should be done. VS won't let you)
* Some bits will only work in windows (no idea of xwt, sorry)

I've been testing this for a few days with 2 of my projects without problems, but maybe my workflow doesn't show them. At least I think it's a good starting port to support file linking referred in #5109

    <Description>Hello

Currently, the only version availaible is the latest, that means if you don't have local backup then it is impossible to revert to old version in case something is wrong

I think keeping old versions in the nuget repo is usefull

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hello...

When I moved over my game development projects to Visual Studio 2015 with Monogame 3.5 I noticed that the project templates were not installed and subsequently not showing up in the C# templates selection.  However, since my projects were correctly referencing the Monogame assemblies I had no issues running my work.  I only noticed this when I wanted to test out a new Monogame extension.

I uninstalled Monogame 3.5 believing it was an issue with my current installation and performed a re-install.  However, during the re-install process all of the available template selections were grayed out and not selectable as a result.

I cancelled the installation and tried the Monogame 3.6 installation finding the same issue.

This appears to be a rather substantial issue on the forums.  Can you supply either good documentation on how to work around this issue or correct the installation application so that we can select our VS templates and get them installed in the proper VS template directories.

I have gone through a number of forum postings and there is a lot of confusion as to what to actually do and only a few of them have the proper link to the templates download on DropBox.

I got mine working as a result but lesser experienced people will have terrible issues with this.

Thank you...

    <Description>When adding a MonoGame iOS Application to a project, and you run your game on an iPhone 7 Plus (and likely other devices), it doesn't render fullscreen. It looks like the whole thing is being scaled up inappropriately.

A good fix is to add a storyboard to serve as a launch screen. Then iOS realizes the app supports the larger resolutions, and displays you in fullscreen as you likely intend.

It'd be great if MonoGame included one by default, or at least some default such that iOS will render the game fullscreen and the device's native resolution.</Description>

    <Description>During Setup() It's instead saving the multiplied matrix

to the 
 - _matrixTransform.SetValue(projection);
that is a readonly and is never updated when a custom effect is added to the SB.Begin.
 - readonly EffectParameter _matrixTransform;

I'm not sure if this is an easy fix, or is instead very complex due to "not all Effects expose a "MatrixTransform" parameter. But the spritebatch should at least warn the user that the projection matrix must be set by hand and the one that is given to the Begin() method will be discarded.

    <CreatedDate>24/03/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>27/03/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>In my 'game' I want to have a maximized window, that is not full-screen.  SDL supports this with `SDL_MaximizeWindow` however the `Sdl` class is `internal` so my Game doesn't have access to it.

So I threaded the function call through GameWindow like this:

By adding a new public Maximize(), Minimize() and Restore() function to GameWindow, SDLGameWindow, and the appropriate function pointers inside Sdl.Window.

* Is this something for which I should create a PR? (but finish it up by adding the functionality to the other desktop platforms) 
* Or would it be better to mark `Sdl` as `public` so my Game code can call it directly.

I also have another issue with Windows where a stylus doesn't register as down for a half second.  Which is infuriating. But can be turned off if you have the HWND through some special Win32 API magic.  
* So I had to add the `SDL_GetWindowWMInfo` function pointer, and then add a new HWND property since GameWindow.Handle and SDLGameWindow._handle point to the SDL_Window and not the HWND.  
* Or if I made `Sdl` `public` then I wouldn't have to create the new property.

What kind of PR would you rather see?  I'm new to MonoGame so I'm not sure if it's better to abstract everything and thread functionality through the main classes, or provide a set of public APIs that you can optionally access if you want.</Description>

    <Description>Probably the bug surface due to the new way of event processing on StoreApps but the root of the problem I believe it to be #2084. The app stays forever in IsActive=false and the game loop doesn't run. 

That's a break from XNA behavior.
Update/Draw should always be called and it's up to the game dev to check Game.IsActive and skip physics , pause the game or whatever.

I suppose we should revert #2084. If there are issues with Suspend and Store certification those should be handled independently on lost of focus &amp; minimize.</Description>

    <CreatedDate>20/03/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>31/08/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>The `checkedRect` change in Texture2D Set/GetData is broken for compressed texture formats:



It doesn't consider that for compressed formats there is a minimum mipmap size that must be enforced.  So it passes the incorrect rectangle down to methods for setting the texture data.

IMO we sure purge this  `checkedRect` business entirely from the code base.

In particular the removal of calling SetData with a `null` rectangle is likely a performance hit.

I am willing to bet that for example `GL.TexSubImage2D` is slower than `GL.TexImage2D` when setting texture data.  Same with the methods under DirectX when the full texture level was being set instead of a sub-rectangle of the texture surface.

IMO we need to refactor all this to restore the old behavior for `null` rectangles and fix the checking when a rectangle is passed to consider compression needs.</Description>

    <ClosedDate>06/06/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>In `Texture2D` in particular it calls `GL.GenerateMipmap` in some form to fill out the mip map chain.

This is wrong.

`GL.GenerateMipmap` literally means "generate mip maps from the level 0 data now".  It reads each pixel of the level 0 data and filters it down to generate mips.  Depending on the target platform on the CPU or the GPU.

It should be painfully obvious that doing this on a empty texture is a waste of time.

Also you cannot call `GL.GenerateMipmap` on compressed textures as GL will not auto generate mips for compressed formats.  It would require GL to compress the texture at runtime which it does not do.  So currently this fails for compressed formats.

Versions of MonoGame from just 6 months ago didn't call `GL.GenerateMipmap` at all:



~~So either A:~~

  - ~~We stop calling `GL.GenerateMipmap` and do nothing for mipmaps on construction (which I don't know is correct).~~

Or B:

 - We correctly define mip levels on a texture by writing a loop and calling `GL.CompressedTexImage2D` or `GL.TexImage2D` for each level.

    <Description>The current implementation of `Texture2D.ValidateParams()` is broken for compressed formats (likely for all... but in particular PVRTC).  This is a critical issue that needs to be resolve ASAP as it makes MonoGame useless for most game development.

It doesn't consider bits per pixel or that there is a min size for some mip levels.  You can see my findings here:




We need to add some specific unit tests for setting/getting data on compressed formats including data on every mip level.</Description>

    <Description>Hi all,

I am trying to make a UWP app for Windows 10 Desktop and IoT to controll a robot via a non-xbox and non-gamepad controller. How can I achive this. 
I tried it with the Joystick.GetState but it always returns the same things. Do I need to define the things in the gamepad db? I do want to avoid this because I want to control it using a custom controller build with a Arduino Micro as HID device.</Description>

    <Description>Having extra buttons is pretty common in mice nowadays, and XNA supported these.
Source of the problem seems to be that the method UpdateMouseState() in WinFormsGameWindow doesn't consider these buttons even though the state is available the same as the other buttons. Fixing this seems trivial, much more so than setting up to make a pull request myself.

    <Description>I'm new using MonoGame. I was testing with the example of Xamarin "WalkingGame".

Here's what I did basically:

1. Created a normal C# Class Library called WalkingGame.Shared
2. Added MonoGame.Framework.Portable nuget package
3. Wrote the game code on this project
4. Created the MonoGame Android project
5. Added WalkingGame.Shared project as a reference and adapt code to use it

Until here everything is ok, the Android version compiles using the shared project and it works.

6. Created the Windows 10 MonoGame project
7. Tried to add the WalkingGame.Shared as reference (same as Android)

Here's where I get the error 

&gt; Unable to add reference to project "WalkingGame.Shared"

One more thing, the project that I've created with the shared code is a regular project, not a  Visual Studio "Shared Code" project.

Can someone advice me to make this work?</Description>

    <Description>Most parts of System.Drawing are already gone, and now the last file that needs to be fixed would be:  This needs to be done so we can get .Net Core supporting more easily when the time comes.

For replacing System.Drawing I would recommend going with either of these:
 - &lt;a href=" - it's fully managed so no need for any dependencies
 - ~~&lt;a href=" - if we are going native we might as well pick a format that SDL understands~~
   - ~~bonus point: we get .ico format, useful for loading window icon~~

    <Description>SoundEffects are processed with the Content Pipeline Tool to an uncompressed format which can make audio files take up a very large percentage of a games' total size. This is the way it was done in XNA (too increase loading speed?), but wouldn't it be good to support a way to build compressed SoundEffects with the Content Pipeline Tool? The trade off for a smaller .xnb size would be a longer loading time but it would be up to each developer to decide if they want to do this tradeoff or not via some setting in the pipeline tool.</Description>

    <ClosedDate>06/06/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I'm using Visual Studio 2015 CE to remotely build and debug an IOS app.  When I build and run the app from Xamarin on my mac, it works fine, but when I try from my PC, the build works, but there is a runtime exception when loading a spritefont:

    System.ArgumentException: elementCount is not the right size, elementCount * sizeof(T) is 131072, but data size is 262144.
    Parameter name: elementCount

Note that the data size is exactly twice expected size.   I suspect this also happens on any texture, but I have not tested that.

Details:
- the font.otf file is incorperated directly in the Content/Fonts folder and is referenced directly from the sprintfont file.
- The "Perform all 32bit floating point operations as 64 bit" option is unchecked
- The IOS project is pretty vanilla.  I haven't altered any compiling options that I can think of.

W8.1 / WP8.1 Screenshots

![w81](

The cause of this is 
which I assume is an attempt to [Automatic Rotation](
 
On W10 the values are still wrong during Game.Initialize(). After initialization W10 receives a SizeChange event that restores the values.
Even if W8.1/WP8.1 got a resize event the same code is present in MetroGameWindow.cs (UAPGameWindow.cs doesn't swap Width/Height),


IMO it's best to remove this code entirely.

A proper implementation would be to change the Orientation when SupportedOrientations= Default and the game is fullscreen or runs in fullscreen environment (WP,Android,iOS).

Personally I think this behavior is confusing and goes a step too far. I found myself fighting against it in XNA in the past when trying to take advantage of the WP7 scaler.

    <Description>Please be seated before reading this.

I've found what I suspect is a bug/change in VS2017 with the $(MSBuildExtensionsPath) variable we use in the Content Pipeline project.

in 2015 and before, this correctly resolves to the MSBUILD folder on the dev machine.

in 2017 however, this is resolving to the Windows 8 MonoGame folder???  so as the Content Pipeline project DLL is nto packages with / per platform, this reference fails.

So need to investigate further to see what's causing this and whether a template change is required or whether we await a Visual Studio fix.

*On a side note
I noticed we don't actually have a proper Content Pipeline DLL, only the PCL one.
Having a full CP NuGet and using that in the project reference may be another easy way to resolve the issue.</Description>

    <ClosedDate>10/03/2017</ClosedDate>

    <Description>Hi,

I'm working on a VR implementation with Monogame for my game engine. The implementation is almost done, however I'm stuck because I need to have an access to the [texture's native pointer](

There is a method called `GetSharedHandle()` that returns an IntPtr which is what I want. But Microsoft doesn't recommand to use it and it's not working in my case (it returns IntPtr.Zero).

Having access to the native pointer is mandatory for a VR implementation using a compositor (Oculus Home, SteamVR and soon OSVR). In fact you have to create two `RenderTarget2D` and pass their `IntPtr` to the VR SDK (the Submit method in my sources).

Without that, you can only have a non direct mode rendering and have to manage the screen size, placement, etc. (this is what Oculus did when the DK1 was released).

I'm working on the three implementations (Oculus, OpenVR and OSVR).

Thanks.

The problem was that some buttons where not working. So looking on how SDL is doing this I ended up filling the gamecontrollerdb.txt file with the ID and mapping resulted from using  and it works. But I needed to recompile all the framework to add it.

To test this quickly I expose some functions in GamePad.SDL.cs to InitDatabase from file so the mappings are loaded on execution, looking for the file in the Content folder.

Why so many useful functions in Sdl class are internal restricted?

I am developing a game it can draw japanese texts, so I usually make spritefonts which use japanese charactor drawing. Size of files for the fonts are too large (more than 120 Megabytes) to load.

I would like to know why, and hope this BUG to be fixed.

    <Description>Hi,

I was using the following lines to display a string using the SpriteBatch in a 3D environment  in the previous versions of MonoGame (and XNA):
``
It was working correctly, even when "mixing" 2D and 3D drawings. It now seems that I must draw the 2D after having drawn all the 3D, which is not why I want, because it can obviously quickly multiply the number of draw calls.

Do you have any idea?
Thank you</Description>

    <Description>Hi guys,

I've noticed that in MonoGame 3.6 ClientSizeChanged (for WinFormsGameWindow) is not invoked anymore when window state changes (normal-&gt;maximized and vice versa). It worked properly for us at v3.5.

As a workaround for this issue I've changed (in WinFormsGameWindow.cs):
``

But that might lead to some side effects...
BTW, I'm using `GraphicsDeviceManager.HardwareModeSwitch = false;`.

    <Title>Problem with Graphics.PreferMultiSampling</Title>
    <CreatedDate>02/03/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>19/05/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Code>C#
// always initialize MultiSampleCount to the maximum, if users want to overwrite
// this they have to respond to the PreparingDeviceSettingsEvent and modify
// args.GraphicsDeviceInformation.PresentationParameters.MultiSampleCount
presentationParameters.MultiSampleCount = GraphicsDevice != null
    ? GraphicsDevice.GraphicsCapabilities.MaxMultiSampleCount
    : 32;


The problem is that in most cases SharpDX will be unable to create the graphics device with `32` multisampling level (BTW, I have NVIDIA GPU, and it seems to work properly only with `8` max multisampling level). And the exception is very cryptic (as usual with SharpDX):
SharpDXException: HRESULT: [0x80070057], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_INVALIDARG/Invalid Arguments], Message: The parameter is incorrect.

But that exception is catched by MonoGame and this one thrown instead:
Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException: Failed to create graphics device!`</Code>
    <Description>Hi guys,

I've noticed that by default if `Graphics.PreferMultiSampling` is set to `true` you're using `32` constant value:
``

So it was a complete mystique to me and required debugging (with using MonoGame source compiled in debug mode) to determine what's going on. Of course I was able to fix this by subscribing to PreparingDeviceSettings and providing proper value to `GraphicsDeviceInformation.PresentationParameters.MultiSampleCount`. But that's not something I wish for other developers to repeat...

I would prefer to have a proper exception thrown instead of using default `32` value which in most cases will lead to these cryptic exceptions. I know it's not that easy because of current architecture, but we definitely need an improvement in that area.
Even using default value `1` for `MaxMultiSampleCount` will be a better option for now. This way no exception is thrown but developer could quite easily see that multisampling is not working and first thought in that case (at least for me) is that multisample count is set to 1.

    <Description>If Texture2D instance is created at runtime by a constructor, that instance is not always empty. By empty I mean, not all pixels are transparent black. In XNA I always get an empty texture (tested on Windows only). 

Now I am not sure if this is intended behavior and I was just lucky that my code worked in XNA as [in docs]( it says:

So my question is: is this a correct behavior and if it is, what is the fastest way to clear a texture to transparent black (is there faster way than SetData())? </Description>

    <Description>**UPD. The information below is wrong - the performance boost was not from SharpDX improvement but from switching MonoGame to RELEASE build from DEBUG.**


I've updated SharpDX to 3.1.0 and got about 300-400% better framerate in our game. Sweet!
Perhaps the improvement is so dramatic because there are a lot of drawcalls (it's too early to optimize this in our game yet).

I was needed to fix a few places in master branch of MonoGame for proper compatibility with it, also SharpDX.Mathematics.dll should be references now as it was separated from the SharpDL.dll.

There are a few drawbacks: starting from 3.0.0 SharpDX requires .NET 4.5. And a problem with MGFX - it seems when SharpDX 3.1.0 is used it tries to compile with D3DCompiler_47.dll which is available (and works) only at Windows 8.1/10 SDK, so Windows 7 is not supported. Perhaps we need to ask at SharpDX repository about this requirement as I didn't found anything related to this.

    <Title>Split MGCB into lib and CLI</Title>
    <CreatedDate>23/01/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>02/05/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Feature request! Or rather proposal because I'd implement this myself if this is accepted.

I'd like to split MGCB into a DLL and a CLI so users can easily use the lib in whatever they like to build on top of the MG build system. The Pipeline Tool could also use that rather than calling the MGCB executable, that would be much nicer IMO. We could call the class library MGCBlib and the CLI just MGCB so we don't actually change the name.

I got this idea when looking at the code a bit to check out issues @UncleThomy ran into. 
That also revealed that the '/define' option is not actually implemented. I'd also generally like to make the CLI a bit more robust and smarter e.g. by allowing spaces in options (and trimming them).

No text appears. However, using the 3.6.0.1365 installer and later framework DLL builds, I narrowed it down to 1365 being the last working version and 1366 the first failing. This build contains #5121 and #5139, so either has caused the regression (could be related to @mrhelmut's comment in #5121?).</Description>

    <Description>This has been an Android issue since MG3.5 (all was good in 3.4). Sound effects usually play fine the first time they play and then hardly ever work after that. Clicking a button that repeatedly plays a sound effect will eventually crash the device too, with the following error:

 AL.Source (SourceId, ALSource3f.Position, _pan, 0, 0.1f);

    <Title>Reapplying GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges() while .IsFullScreen = true may cancel Fullscreen</Title>
    <CreatedDate>09/01/2017</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>09/01/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>When I call graphics.ApplyChanges() while in fullscreen, despite having graphics.IsFullScreen = true, the game reverts back to windowed. This usually happens right when I call .ApplyChanges() again, but may occasionally take more attempts. 

While in this state, the game is effectively windowed, but the .IsFullScreen property is still true. The problem persists until I set .IsFullScreen back to false, apply, set it back to true and apply again. It's especially bothersome when a user tries to change the resolution while in fullscreen, as this action requires an .ApplyChanges() call while already in fullscreen, thus triggering the problem. The only workaround I see for this is to hop to windowed and back, but this looks very ugly.

To replicate, create a new project and add the following to the Game1 class (rewriting the existing functions where necessary):
     
    KeyboardState last_state;

    protected override void Initialize() {
        last_state = Keyboard.GetState();
        base.Initialize();
    }

    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) {

        if(Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Enter) &amp;&amp; !last_state.IsKeyDown(Keys.Enter)) {
            graphics.IsFullScreen = true;
            graphics.ApplyChanges();
        }
        last_state = Keyboard.GetState();

        base.Update(gameTime);
    }

When running the game, pressing Enter the first time will trigger fullscreen as intended. Pressing Enter again (or in some cases, several times) will trigger the problem. The screen is back to windowed and stays there no matter how many times you press Enter.</Description>

2. The same as option 1 but the color properties have setters which populate the dictionary beside setting the property's field. This way it still have the original performance when getting color by its property, but the code is uglier: a lot of copy/paste and the setter have hidden behavior (adding a value to a dictionary). But I think it is still the better solution since the setter is private.

Example:
c#
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Colors library
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    private static Dictionary&lt;string, Color&gt; Colors = new Dictionary&lt;string, Color&gt;();

    private static Color transparent;

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Transparent color (R:0,G:0,B:0,A:0).
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public static Color Transparent
    {
        get { return transparent; }
        private set
        {
            transparent = value;
            Colors["transparent"] = value;
        }
    }

    . . . .

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Get color by name.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public static Color Parse(string name)
    {
        name = name.ToLower();
        if (Colors.Contains(name))
        {
            return Colors[name];
        }
        else
        {
            new ArgumentException("Color not found.");
        }
    }
`</Code>
    <Description>It would be nice if we can get color by its name (string).

A good example would be scripting. You get the color from a file as a string and you have to convert it to Color. Right now the only way to achieve this is to use Reflection which is both slow and error-prone (you risk getting a non-color property for instance, so you have to check) or make a library class (basically a dictionary) and enter all of them on your own. The second solution is fine if you want to support only a handful of colors, but it will become a real chore to input if you want to have all 140 of them.

I have a few ideas of how to implement this:
1. Use static Dictionary&lt;string, Color&gt; to store the colors. The static constructor will set the colors in the dictionary and the color properties will become just getters that will get the color from the dictionary. This way getting the color will be somewhat slower than it is now since it a lookup in the dictionary have to be made.

Example:
``

3. Use reflection to find the color. This way the only change made would be to write the methods, but there would be a big performance penalty because of the reflection. Personally, I don't like this solution at all, although probably it's the easiest to implement.

If the admins give it a go, I can implement one of the options (preferably the second) and make a pull request.</Description>

    <Description>A quick question: should we only use old C# syntax and features or we can use more recent ones like `nameof()` or `??` `?.` operators that came with VS 2015?

If we should support older version how far back to go?</Description>

    <Description>Hello friends,
why are structs like vector, vertexpositiontexture et cetera not marked as serializable?
It would be a great help.. espacially when saving exempli gratia vertex-chunks or something as bytes.

Is there a possiblity to "fix" it or do I need to recreate these structs marked as serializable?

        <Title>OpenAssetImporter Improvements and FbxImporter Unit Tests</Title>
        <Description>This PR is related to 

I extended the material support in `OpenAssetImporter` to export all the material features exposed by AssImp.  This breaks anyone that uses `OpenAssetImporter` directly... but hopefully for the better.

`FbxImporter` and `XImporter` now pass a flag to `OpenAssetImporter` asking for XNA compatibility returning just the material properties expected under XNA 4.0.  I added a unit test for `FbxImporter` to help prove that nothing has changed or is broken.

It is debatable if this is necessary or if we're ok passing additional non-XNA material properties from `FbxImporter` and `XImporter` .</Description>

    <Description>I have recently installed MonoDevelop and MonoGame and while trying to create a Portable Library (PCL)   it will fail with this message.
![screenshot from 2017-01-05 17-14-33](

Creating a shared library and a standard application work fine and creating a normal portable library, not a MonoGame one, works fine as well
I got the monogame-sdk.run from the development branch on your website however the same thing did occur with MonoGame 3.5 as well.

I am running Antergos Linux which is a derivative of Arch (Not sure if you officially support this) and dependencies are as such:
MonoDevelop : 6.3
gtk-sharp3 : 2.99.3-1
referenceassemblies-pcl : 4.6-1
mono : 4.6.1.3-1
mono-addins : 1.1-1

If you need any other information please let me know

    <ClosedDate>19/01/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>@cra0zy This is specifically related to some changes you made.

I just updated my Monogame install to the latest dev build (specifically 3.6.0.1246) after a couple months (was running an old dev build).

When I tried running my game, I was getting an exception when trying to enable window resizing viz.             Window.AllowUserResizing = true;

The exception was: "SDL 2.0.4 does not support changing resizable parameter of the window after it's already been created".

It looks like this change was made by you ~2 months ago:



It seems that even though the code changes for this are in the latest dev installer, the actual SDL2.dll that is bundled is version 2.0.4 and not version 2.0.5.

I manually updated my DLL to 2.0.5 and that seems to have fixed the problem.

It would be great to get the updated DLL into the installer as well.

Thanks.

    <Description>Hello,
I assume that I could reproduce a bug in which the specified GetData method ( with startIndex and count) wants an array of size [startIndex + count] instead of [count].
The main problem is now that the array of the size [startIndex + count] is filled to index [startIndex] with standard values .
Not until index[startIndex] the whole array is filled with dumb.
Only from index [startIndex] to the end of the array are the requested vertices.

Is there no possibility to acquire only those vertices between startIndex and count ? Otherwise too much redundancy is present.

    <Description>Just downloaded the nightly. Last time i downloaded this was a couple weeks ago around the 4th i think and it was working fine. The maximize button is also not working. Im running win7 gl 

&gt; An unhandled exception of type 'System.Exception' occurred in MonoGame.Framework.dll
&gt; 
&gt; Additional information: SDL 2.0.4 does not support changing resizable parameter of the window after it's already been created, please use a newer version of it.

^ this cant be right this is a basic thing too boot it wont even work in the constructor.  
Its basically stuck on false and cannot be resized first thing i saw. Ah god this is horrible lol.

This however now works like it did in xna within initialize.
&gt; graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = 1000;
&gt; graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = 800;
&gt; graphics.ApplyChanges();

This is going to be like really annoying. Having to manually reset the window size constantly by typing in new numbers, i need that for my tests im running.

Edit.

Some where between the 4th version .0187 and the 10th it got busted. (i put back in 0187 this is going to be more difficult then just turning of the mouse). Unfortunately i wanted to use at least the version out on the 10th for the mouse garbage fix but its got the resize bug as well. I actually need both to work.

    <Description>Hey there.

Since Monodevelop 6 Flatpak doesn't work with Monogame, I was told to try and compile from source. After following this guide:



I have received these errors:

`

Now it actually was working, I had it compiled and built on my desktop. I decided though that now it was working, I thought it'd be a better idea to move it to a more, out the way folder. It stopped working, nor did it work when I started from scratch and recompile it, nor did it work if I tried going back to the desktop. This is so frustrating :/ Any tips?</Description>

So I'm wondering if the corruption is a bug or not because being able to use a chunk of the texture in edge cases like this would save a expensive GetData call.</Description>

    <Description>Hi,

I just did OSX update and had issues with monogame 3.5 (installed from pkg installer) and xamarin studio. Xamarin Addin seems to not work anymore (template not available), and old project (Crossplatform desktop) seems to compile but not exec (no exception thrown) and stop when loading mono drawing.dll. I tried with visual studio express (preview on mac) and everything works, visual studio use mono 4.8 and Xamarin studio use mono 4.6.2.
Is there any way to install / copy addin from xamarin to visual studio, or I need to recompile it ?  

Also tried with the 3.6 (addin available in xamarin beta channel) and I had issue explained here #5346

My theme is Adwaita (the default for GTK3.0+). There's a list of icons that every theme should have here: 
There's an "image-missing" icon in that list, which should be a good fit given the semantics.

Running in a near empty project at about 3500 fps it creates about 1 megabyte of garbage in a minute. 
Its quite annoying not because its a huge amount but because its a constant source of garbage that basically must be on. If you want to have mouse functionality in your game.</Description>

    <Description>There should be pre, execution, and post events for things in the Game class.

base.Initialize and other overridden methods shouldn't rely on being executed last, and could benefit by being called one after another wherever the first get's called, instead of being chained.

A use case for an InitializationEvent in the pre execution state would be as follows:
Initializing classes that are required before Initialization gets called. I realize this is a broad use case, but it covers a lot of different scenarios.</Description>

    <Description>While @nkast has done some great work with his low level optimizations there is still more to be done.

For example all of these functions in `SpriteBatch`:
``

All redirect to the same `DrawInternal` method which does a common set of optimizations.  We do this mainly to make the code easier to read and maintain as well as to void bugs.  This however comes at the expensive of performance.

Take `void Draw(Texture2D texture, Vector2 position, Color color)` for example.  This draw doesn't need rotation, doesn't need flipping of sprites, doesn't need UV calculations.  If this function created its own `SpriteBatchItem` internally it could do so much more efficiently than `DrawInternal` does now.

Same goes for the other specializations of `Draw` and `DrawFont` in `SpriteBatch`.  This matters when games are drawing 1000s for sprites per frame.

While this does mean a lot more duplicate code... it also means much more performance.  We can deal with the issue of duplicate code via more unit tests.  Performance here is more important.</Description>

    <Description>Hello,

Since the dependencies for SDL 2.0.5 have been updated, MonoGame doesn't work anymore on MacOS Sierra (but does on prior versions).

I rebuilt SDL from scratch and it works, so I believe the build process of the dylib was missing something.

I'm going to push an update to the dependencies.</Description>

    <Description>Using:
- NuGet WindowsDX package 3.6.0.1184 OR Dev installer from downloads page
- Visual Studio 2015
- Windows 10 Home Insider Preview

Steps to recreate:
- Create new project
- Add Monogame WindowsDX package 3.6.0.1184
- Add this to Initialize:
``
- Set a breakpoint anywhere in the Update method
- Run project

Problem:
Game launches, breakpoint is hit, but game window gets stuck in the foreground and it's very hard to close it.  Alt tab, windows key, even ctrl+alt+escape for task manager doesn't work.  The only way I've gotten around it is by using the multiple desktop function of Insider Preview to open task manager on another desktop and then killing vshost32.exe.  I've done some experimentation and it seems like it's not actually crashed, it just doesn't yield foreground control to Visual Studio.  I can drag VS to another desktop and it functions normally, properly stopped at the breakpoint I set.</Description>

    <ClosedDate>27/03/2020</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>After upgrading from 3.4 to 3.5.1 (and then 3.6) I noticed that calling ContentManager.Unload() doesn't lessen the amount of memory being used by the game, as seen in the Diagnostic Tools of VS2015 and the Resource Monitor on Windows. Loading, unloading, then reloading the same content would originally keep the memory usage about the same, but now it continues to increase during every Load() while not decreasing during Unload(). 

I tested this further by installing v3.4 again and using the same project and code. Loading and unloading the same content as before now has the desired effect where the memory usage increases during Load() and decreases after Unload(), as expected.</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Dragging the vertical separator in the Pipeline Tool of the left side of the window will cause a crash due to `Drawable.Width` not accepting negative values. Easy fix is to use 0 if the value is negative, but maybe it makes more sense to have a minimum width (larger than 0). 
If you drag the seperator all the way to the right it can go beyond the visible window, making it impossible to make the build view visible again without resizing the window.

Ive also received error 2004 once.

I am getting this error several minutes after the program has started running. I am not sure what is causing it. I've seen some other issues posted. But they were fairly different or were closed citing that newer versions should "fix" the problem. 

Similar to[ issue 741]( I am passing the spritefont to different objects. But I haven't had this issue in older versions of Monogame or XNA. 

I am noticing the GC is going nuts, but only to this project (on the newer version of MG).  I dont use dispose on any of the textures manually, as everything is being used for the whole game.

    <Description>I think I have found a bug in 2MGFX.

I have a FXAA shader that compiles fine in the 3.5 version of 2MGFX but fails to compile with some strange errors in the latest version from the development branch.

I have attached the shader with a bat file that processes it both successfully with the old version and shows the new failure.

I have about 20 other effects being compiled with the latest 2MGFX correctly. The issue only effects this shader.

    <Title>Certain Draw overload misplaces Rectangles and ignores scale</Title>
    <CreatedDate>21/11/2016</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>10/12/2018</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>When using the overload
`Draw(Texture2D texture, Vector2? position = null, Rectangle? destinationRectangle = null, Rectangle? sourceRectangle = null, Vector2? origin = null, float rotation = 0.0f, Vector2? scale = null, Color? color = null, SpriteEffects effects = SpriteEffects.None, float layerDepth = 0.0f)`

the scale is ignored, but only if you give a destinationRectangle (not ignored when using the Vector2 position)
I get that you are supposed to supply either Vector2 + scale OR the Rectangle, but the whole overload is really misleading imo.

Edit: just found another bug with the same overload:
This line works as expected: (not the buggy overload)
`_spriteBatch.Draw(testTex, rect, Color.White);`
while this one draws the rectangle on a completely different place: (buggy overload, should do nearly the same)
`_spriteBatch.Draw(testTex, destinationRectangle: rect, color: Color.White, origin: new Vector2(rect.Width / 2f, rect.Height / 2f));`</Description>

    <Description>Visual studio 2017 RC has been release (  ), and the current Monogame installer (3..6 dev) does not support installing the templates into the new version.

Loading an existing project into VS2017 does seem to work. Even existing Xamarin / mobile projects appear to be working. It's just the Monogame templates are missing for adding / creating new projects.

FYI, it appears as though the VS2017 installer comes with the options to install Unity out of the box. Would be pretty awesome to have Monogame as an option when installing VS2017.</Description>

    <Description>I am getting this runtime error (pasted below) every time I try to run my project. It has only happened since a couple of hours ago, and I can't think of anything significant that I changed that could have caused the problem. Somehow it suddenly stopped working. The last thing I did was toying around with the `ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;` class and adding the System assembly for it to my project. I already tried removing all of that again but it doesn't seem to be the cause of the problem.

I am using Fedora 24 with Mono 4.6.2 and the latest MonoGame dev build from the downloads section.

    <Description>InputEvents.cs is where the keyboard/mouse events are attached to allow MonoGame to collect input.

If the mouse is moving/clicking then keyboard input is delayed until it stops. This includes key released states, so it effects first person game very badly.

Attaching to the CoreWindow's keyboard and mouse events shows this.
Attached to the CoreIndependentInputSource for the Mouse, with the keyboard coming from the CoreWindow (standard practice) also causes this.

    <Description>I am using MonoGame 3.6.0.906 on MacOS. I am trying to get some mouse input code working, but I have found some strange behaviour. It appears that the mouse position does not update when the left button is pressed. This makes it impossible to implement mouse dragging input.

To investigate, I added print statements when the left mouse button is pressed, when is released and the mouse position every update. I then tried clicking and dragging. The mouse definitely moved when the left button was down.

Probably the error is because he expects a xnb file, but I only have a .PNG because Linux does not found a way to convert. Could someone help me?

I don't know why some are played like that because all of them are .ogg files.

Also, you should test the songs too. In my case I only have one and it's played stereo but who knows having more than one.

If we call graphics.ApplyChanges() inside the Game constructor it has no effect on XNA and MG 3.5. It was most likely ignored.
With the latest develop build we get an error later inside Initialize()
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException] = {System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80004005): Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component.}

    <Description>There is no simple way, at least not one that I am aware of, to create a CI build for a UWP MonoGame project, for example.The content pipeline requires a dependency to:`&lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\MonoGame\v3.0\MonoGame.Content.Builder.targets" /&gt;`which is fine on a developer machine, but the main issue is that MonoGame Installer( requires administrative credentials, and that's not allowed on a build machine that you don't have admin credentials, like VSTS's Hosted Build (There should be a way to easily install all MonoGame Content Pipeline dependencies locally, or something else.It's really bad to not be able to use this kind of setup.I already apologize if there is a way that I'm not aware of, but I tried several ways to do this and got into a dead end.Maybe we can have a "portable" ContentPipeline, maybe like a zipfile with all dependencies to MGCB.exe distributed as easily as we have the MonoGameSetup.exe, on a static URL at monogame.net website.Any ideas on how to provide such a setup would be appreciated.</Description>

    <Description>@Linchy mentioned in a PR that the Pipeline Tool does not look as nice as it could because of inconsistent colors. I agree! :) It looks like the icons were scrapped together a bit and colors are quirky. I took a screenshot and added some remarks:![pipelineaesthethics](So IMO it's mostly the icons and the build indicators. Can't we use icons from the [Visual Studio Image Library]( or other actual Windows icons (not sure about licensing but surely we should be able to use Windows icons)?cc @cra0zy By the way, awesome job on the Linux version, it looks great! I also like the cogs with settings for the Build Output and Properties :) I think there are a bunch of open issues on the Pipeline Tool that you already fixed. I'll go through them in a while to see which can be closed.</Description>

    <Description>When any resource (for example a `Texture2D` or `Effect`) is loaded through a `ContentManager` instance, is then `Dispose()`d explicitly at a later time, there is no way to load this resource through the same `ContentManager` instance again.Example code:``The texture resource _"test"_ in this example can never be loaded through the same `ContentManager` again because it has been disposed and the `ContentManager` keeps a record of all resources loaded which makes it return the same disposed resource instance.I have tested this, and it works the same way with XNA, but I am wondering if this is intended behavior with disposed resources, because besides creating a new `ContentManager` instance, I don't see a way of loading a disposed resource at a later time.And to do this, I need to keep a record of disposed resources per `ContentManager` myself to predict when I need a new `ContentManager` just to load a disposed resource.My opinion on this is that when I call `Load&lt;T&gt;`, I do NOT expect it to return an already disposed resource, even if I disposed this resource earlier, as there is no way to remove this disposed resource instance from the internal `ContentManager` record.</Description>

Is this available anywhere? I didn't find any information about this in their public docs.Also does this mean I have to buy Xamarin to use Monogame in the PS4?</Description>

    <Description>I'm running into so many problems today with the tool:1. can't press the DEL key when changing 'reference' paths, it gives an error dialog.2. I have to reference the exact dll for custom importers, meaning when I change to x86 configuration and make a change it doesn't know about it as it's still looking at bin/debug. Additionally the ref paths don't support ($OutDir) and other macros so I can't automate this??3. Re-adding a reference doesn't register in the importer dialog, it just says '[missing] tmx importer'. But then I clean and rebuild and it works...4. I can't have the tool open and build my projects, as VS tries to replace importer dlls but it can't as the tool has them locked.5. I keep my mgcb file in a seperate project with just that in, because it has so many issues (an attempt to isolate it), but now any changes I make to files don't get registered. Shouldn't it go 'build main project -&gt; build content project -&gt; build mgcb as there were changes' ??6. It doesn't support x86 importers. Fine. But at least tell me instead of just letting me add the dll as if it is all ok!!7. [UI] When building things the scrollbar doesn't go to the bottom and I can't see what is currently building.8. [UI] It highlights some of my shaders as failed to build with red, but actually they did and it is just warnings?!9. [UI] Always asks me if I want to save before building. Can this not just be automatic? In what instance would I not want to save before building?So many problems. I'd like to contribute fixes if possible, if you point me in the right direction to get started.This is with the `Monogame Pipeline Tool v3.5.1.1679`</Description>

    <Description>Just wanted to give a heads up that the current [MonoGame for MacOS]( download on the MonoGame website contains an old version of the MonoDevelop plugin for Xamarin Studio. The old plugin doesn't work with current version of Xamarin Studio (6.0.2b73 in my case), making it difficult to actually use MonoGame, or even tell that it was successfully installed. This can be mitigated by updating the install package to use the current 'MonoGame Addin' (version 3.6.0.586 at the time of writing) to Xamarin Studio.Also, if anyone finds this post via search engine, this issue can be fixed by opening Xamarin Studio (after installing MonoGame), tapping "Xamarin Studio [Community]" &gt; Add-ins... &gt; Updates and updating the MonoGame add-in</Description>

    <Description>XNA had a sample for dealing with localised assets [1]. I think it might be a  good idea to add these as default processors to the MG content Pipeline so they are just built in.So Im proposing we add the  `LocalizedFontDescription` and `LocalizedFontProcessor` code from the sample and then add a new method to the contentManager`T LoadLocalized&lt;T&gt;(string assetName)`People can then have the choice of loading using the standard Load method or using the other if that asset has a localized version.[1] </Description>

    <Description>Greetings, for an online course with MonoGame, I downloaded the installer for version 3.5.1.1679 of MonoGame.At first I thought I could only use Visual Studio 2010 for the assignments, specially because the installer only showed me the option to install the templates for 2010, but later I realized that VS Express 2013 was installed (I'm using a friend's computer) However, when I reran the installer, the option for 2013 was still grayed out, and yes, I ran Visual Studio 2013 at least once before trying.Checking previous issues like #4612 or #4782, I checked the registry, and I can't see a UserProjectTemplatesLocation key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\12.0However, it does exits in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VWDExpress\12.0Is this an issue of the instalation of VS2013 in this computer, not creating the key in the other location? Or the installer is failing to check the key for Express?Thanks in advance.</Description>

            {
                this.Exit();

in the beginning of update (I believe this is a fair way to do it, isn't it ?)
just do:


Platform.Exit();
 _suppressDraw = true;


and on windows DX (at least) leads to:


if (_window != null)
                _window.Dispose();
            _window = null;
            Window = null;


so in the game Update method, if window is used AFTER the call to exit like with something like this:


if (!IsMouseVisible)
                Mouse.SetPosition(200, 200);


Lead to an error as window instance has been disposed before:

    <Description>It would be very useful for the `MGCB` tool to gather content statistics.  The statistics would be generated when content building occurs and would be persisted to an XML file.Example of statistics we could gather would be:- Number of models in the project.- MBs of compressed `SoundEffect` s.- Percentage of uncompressed vs compressed `Texture2D`s.- The disk space required for all content.- The approximate memory usage in game of all content.- The amount of textures in a particular folder.These statistics then could be parsed and presented in the Pipeline tool UI in some useful manner.Ideally most of the information could be gathered from the builder without the help of individual processors.  Types of content, what folders they exist in, number of files, disk space required, etc can be all gathered from the outside.  Things like if the content is compressed or not or the runtime memory usage would require either some cooperation from the processor to work efficiently.  We could easily add additional methods to the `ContentProcessorContext` or the base `ContentItem` to help record the necessary information.This feature would make diagnosing content size issues easier and more accurate than the guessing and runtime measurements we have to do now. </Description>

    <Description>I got the below crash report a little while ago (from a Windows 7 SP1 machine):``The crash occurred while trying to create the graphics device. From what I can tell, it seems like a driver issue (probably a fresh install of Windows without video drivers being installed). Unfortunately I wasn't able to contact the user who reported it (they submitted an invalid e-mail), so I couldn't investigate the cause.But I guess the main issue here is not that an exception occurred, but that MonoGame threw a SharpDX exception when trying to create the graphics device. I'm not sure, but I think in this case XNA would likely throw a `NoSuitableGraphicsDeviceException` ( Does anyone know more about how XNA would handle this?Thoughts?</Description>

    <Title>[WinDX] Opening Steam overlay results in "stuck" keys</Title>
    <CreatedDate>19/08/2016</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>28/08/2016</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I'm currently working on Steam integration with my game and I came across an issue when opening the Steam overlay. The Shift and Tab keys (which you press to open the overlay) end up getting "stuck" in the game. I'm assuming this is because the Steam overlay intercepts all the key events, so MonoGame never sees the "release" events for these keys.I'm having this problem with the WinDX build, but I imagine it also affects other desktop builds. (UPDATE: This actually seems to only affect MonoGame DirectX. Both XNA and MonoGame SDL2 work correctly.)My current workaround to this issue is to clear MonoGame's internal key buffer (i.e. `Keyboard._keys`) whenever the Steam overlay is opened or closed. However given this is not publicly exposed, the only way to do this is by changing MonoGame to expose it or by using reflection. I am not sure if this is the best way of dealing with this, but it seems to work well.Has anyone else experienced this particular problem? And if so, how did you solve it?And if my workaround seems reasonable, would it be acceptable to add this to the MonoGame API (e.g. a `Keyboard.Flush` method which clears the buffer)? If so, I'm more than happy to submit a PR.</Description>

    <Description>When starting to fix #1455 I thought it might be a good idea to do parameter validation for GetData and SetData in a seperate method so we do the same checks in both, don't have duplicate code here and have a better overview of it. Maybe even abstract some of the checks up to Texture itself since this code can be shared for the most part and it'll make the checks consistent for all Texture types. I just realized the same methods exist for Vertex/IndexBuffers, not sure if we should share all around or just do textures. Thoughts on this?Also, there are cases the checks miss because sizeof(T) was is always expected to be equal to 4 (which is expected to be the size of the format, but that isn't always the case either) and the size of T is not explicitly checked while in XNA it is. I'm happy to fix all this once we decide on the above paragraphs.</Description>

    <Description>Hey,When trying to run a MonoGame application on the WindowsGL x86 platform, I get a PInvokeStackImbalance on an alGenFilters() call, and if I continue execution I get another one on alDeleteFilters():![image](I narrowed this down to the calling convention being incorrect for at least these two functions, but also likely all of the ones that are dynamically added via Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer. The main OpenAL functions declare their calling conventions as Cdecl, but those added via EffectsExtension() do not declare any calling convention at all.To fix this, I just specified the calling convention on the delegates at OpenAL.cs:546.``I don't have any other build configurations and I'm not sure if this is the correct way to fix it, so I haven't made a pull request. _Likely also need to do this with the Effect API above too,_ though my application doesn't seem to use it.</Description>

    <Description>This [sound]( works fine on Windows GL, Windows DX, and Windows UWP using the current develop branch. Does not work on MacOS using the cross platform template (Android, iOS, and Xamarin.mac give different errors). On the Mac, it fails at the Content.Load&lt;SoundEffect&gt;("testsound"). XS gets a spin cursor for a while before it really stops, almost like it is gotten into a nested loop allocating memory or trying to allocate a really large chunk. The error I get isn't very helpful and I do not know where to set the breakpoint to see the actual error.``</Description>

    <Description>I already commented this in the commit, but seems to be ignored or something.In DynamicSoundEffectInstanceManager.UpdatePlayingInstances() is an iteration over all playingInstances with a check of IsAlive and getting the target of a WeakReference. This can generate in very rare cases NullReferenceExceptions because the GC removes the instance between these lines of code.The check should - like in all other cases of weak references I found in the source code - check Target directly to null.</Description>

    <Description>For **XAudio**, when there are voices that are not yet disposed when [MasterVoice is disposed]( a crash will occur as noted in [`SoundEffect.Shutdown`]( This caused our unit tests to fail in #5042. We currently have [`SoundEffectInstancePool`]( to manage all SoundEffectInstances (and dispose of them in the Shutdown method) and [`DynamicSoundEffectInstanceManager`]( to manage **playing** DynamicSoundEffectInstances, but not ones that are not currently playing. I suggest we let the DSEIManager handle this by having it keep a WeakReference to all instances that are not playing as well.</Description>

    <Description>I'm currently working on implementing a render batching pipeline for 3D rendering in Protogame, and I need some way of imitiating the "Effect" class without actually having the costs associated with it.  The current render context in the engine has an `Effect` property with the `Effect` type on it.In particular, a lot of the code currently looks like:``which internally then calls renderContext.Effect or whatever.I'd like to be able to have a fake Effect, one that the render batcher can provide which tracks all of the state changes made to the effect and it's parameters (like setting of textures and other values) as the game's render loop runs.Once the render loop is about to finish, the render batcher would then look at all of the render requests that came through, sort them based on the most optimal way to run them (i.e. group requests where the effect and effect parameters are the same) and then push them to the GPU, reducing the number of draw calls to make.  I want to basically take the game render loop, which may render a whole bunch of different things with different effects, and combine them together into very few draw calls, potentially also making use of `DrawInstancedPrimitives` to reduce it even further.However, so much of the code is coupled to the Effect API, and because this is a concrete class, it makes it hard to use the API without incurring associated costs, or without the render batching having to clone the effect and it's parameters on every request (itself an expensive operation).I can't just switch out Effect with some other common API either, because it implements no interfaces, and I want render batching to be optional; if you don't want to use render batching, you shouldn't have to, so it's important that the effect setup can actually be a real effect when needed, and not a fake effect supplied by the render batcher for the purposes of tracking changes.My proposal is to add an `IEffect` interface and potentially an `IEffectParameter` interface, where their signatures would match the current public APIs of the `Effect` and `EffectParameter` classes.  This would allow me to transparently replace effect with a fake tracking version as needed.</Description>

    <Description>Hello,With SDL, when one start a project without touching a `GamePad`, triggers axis have a wrong default value until any button/axis of the gamepad is touched.Steps to reproduce:1. Start application without touching the gamepad at all.2. Notice that `SDL_GameControllerGetAxis` returns 16384 for both of the triggers axis (should be 0) which translates to 0.5f `GamePadState.Triggers.Left` (which is supposed to be halfway in).3. Touch any axis / press any button of the gamepad (it doesn't have to be one of the triggers).4. Notice that `SDL_GameControllerGetAxis` now returns 0 and other valid values.Tested on Windows &amp; MacOS with multiple controllers. Does this look like a SDL issue?I remember that OpenTK had the same issue.</Description>

    <Description>@tomspilman #5024 caused this issue (the commit before it worked fine). [`monitor.Description.DesktopBounds`]( gets incorrect values (1536, 864) which is not a known displaymode for my graphics card, causing adapter._currentDisplayMode not to be set. `GraphicsDevice.DisplayMode` will be null and so [`GraphicsDevice.Setup`]( will fail with a `NullReferenceException`.Looks like this is an issue with SharpDX or maybe incorrect use of the API? I couldn't find this in SharpDX source, so maybe this was a bug that is fixed or API changed. I just updated my graphics drivers, but that didn't help.</Description>

    <Description>@cra0zy was told you like the UX issues!I am using Windows 10 with the latest dev build (28 July 2016). The pipeline has some funny resizing issues as seen below. I did steps 1-5 in order.1: To get that build action dropdown menu I had to double click (I think before at home on win 7 its just already there).2: resized the internal window and the dropdown selector part stays where it was. (see 6 for a bad one)3: Clicking again jumps it back to full size.4-5: Resizing the internal bit again makes the small window scrollable, you have to scroll to far right to drop down again etc.6:  a bonus image showing it quite getting in the way.![pipe](</Description>

    <Description>**Platform**: OpenGL**Version**: Latest commit and Release 3.5.1**Issue**: Destination offset is wrong, count is wrong**Reproducing**: This is a ~very~ specific case-scenario, but it can happen easily and there's no clear explanation of whats happening.If you declare a float4x4 in your code and only use it to get a float3 result, it will become a float4x3 with a warning ( "implicit truncation of vector type" ).Issue is, now we don't have enough space to store float4x4 data (64 bytes), only 48 bytes.Example of the problem:``This will build correctly though 2MGFX on OpenGL, but with a warning. When you apply the pass the data won't be able to be copied.**Solution**: 1. Change float4x4 to float4x3 on everything that you won't need a float4 result.or2. Change "implicit truncation of vector type" from a warning to an error.Though it's a simple mistake, I think this can be a block to newcomers (riemers.net tutorials wouldn't work, for example, which is pretty much how I started learning HLSL).</Description>

    <Description>We're going to be moving the MonoGame repo from its current location here: ... to the MonoGame organization here: We've discuss things with GitHub support staff and the transfer should be 100% transparent as all URLs will redirect to the new location.  Existing clones or forks won't be affected in any way.All the stars and fork stats for the repo also transfer in the move.There might be a little issues with the Gitter chat room, but the Gitter staff said they could manually fix things if we have issues.</Description>

    <Description>After switching from the stable 3.5 release to the latest development build of Monogame, I ran into a few problems. One of them has been resolved already, another has an open issue, #4740, and the last is this.In my game, in order to avoid drawing a lot of tiles at once, which was eating up CPU, I set it up so that the tiles are drawn to a RenderTarget2D and the RenderTarget2D itself is drawn instead, and only updated as needed when tiles are added or removed. I initialized the RenderTarget2D something like this:`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 10000, 10000);`With 3.5, this works fine. But with the latest build, it throws a SharpDXException, with the following information (I edited out the irrelevant parts of the stack trace):&gt; SharpDX.SharpDXException was unhandled&gt;   HResult=-2147024809&gt;   Message=HRESULT: [0x80070057], Module: [General], ApiCode: [E_INVALIDARG/Invalid Arguments], Message: The parameter is incorrect.&gt; &gt;   Source=SharpDX&gt;   StackTrace:&gt;        at SharpDX.Result.CheckError()&gt;        at SharpDX.Direct3D11.Device.CreateTexture2D(Texture2DDescription&amp; descRef, DataBox[] initialDataRef, Texture2D texture2DOut)&gt;        at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.Texture2D.CreateTexture()&gt;        at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.RenderTarget2D.GenerateIfRequired()&gt;   InnerException: Further experimentation showed that the exception is directly related to the size of the RenderTarget2D being initialized. Constructing it at a much smaller width and height works fine. I did some testing and found the point where the exception is thrown.This constructor works fine.`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 4096, 4096);`This constructor throws the exception.`blocks = new RenderTarget2D(graphics.GraphicsDevice, 4097, 4096);`4096 is a very binary number... That doesn't seem like a coincidence. Is this a bug or a correct limit to the size of a RenderTarget2D?</Description>

    <Description>Whenever I add a song to my content app, no matter if it's MP3/WAV/WMA I get a .WMA file of the same song together with the XNBs. So I've never published a Monogame project from VS and I guess in the final product there shouldn't be any .WMA files in that folder, right? Otherwise it would be too easy to steal copyrighted songs, for instance. I remember XNA having identical behavior too. So can someone shed some light on this? I don't see .PNG files where my texture XNBs are, neither I see .WAV files where my sounds are... So this only happens with songs. Why?![Screenshot](</Description>

    <Description>Since Monogame calles itself the _spiritual successor to XNA_ and not _a Mono-compatible re-implementation of XNA_, I was wondering if there any plans to move away from the current API design  to get Monogame ready for future requirements, improve components etc., essentially making it XNA-incompatible?Amongst the things which are annoying me since the early days of XNA (and now Monogame) for example is the `Game` class, the _two-step-initialization_ paradigm and the references to `Game` all over the place. It's just bad design. Also that many components which would be helpful to re-create an own, better main `Game` class are internal (e.g. `GamePlatform`).Take this for example:``What happens here? The `GraphicsDeviceManager` takes the current `Game` instance as a parameter which is essentially used to register itself in the game service collection of the game, only to be retrieved in a service-locating manner later from the `Game`. This makes it not only impossible to properly test the `GraphicsDeviceManager`, it also isn't really obvious that the game requires an instance of the type (otherwise it crashes). Not very nice.I know it's not you guys fault, it's just how XNA was designed. Hence I'm asking - are there any plans to drop the design alltogether in favor of modern standards, extensibility and more cleaner seperation of components?</Description>

    <Description>Hello,I am attempting to split out some content so I can use 2 seperate `ContentManager` instances.I assumed if I referenced two seperate `mgcb` files from my project, that I could get them to output their content to different directories when I build my project.When creating a `ContentManager` you need to give it a root directory, so I assumed I could create one for each content directory where my `mgcb` content is output:``The problem is, when I build the project, the assets from the multilple referenced `mgcb`s are always output directly to the `content` folder under py projects output directory. Furthermore, the 1st output is cleared when the 2nd `mgcb` is built, and so I actually only end up with the content of the 2nd `mgcb` file in by output directory.Here is how it looks (note I added the `mgcb` files using `Add as Link`![image](It doesn't seem to matter which folder in my project that I add the reference to the `mgcb` too, when I build they always seem to output to the outputDir/Content folder for my project.This means I don't end up with seperate root paths to create my ContentManager instances for, and also the build clearing the content output by the first mgcb when it builds the second one is obvioulsy a bit problematic!Any ideas?</Description>

    <Description>To test #4875 I wanted to try the [InstancedModel Sample]( but I ran into some issues importing a .fbx model. - First there was a problem in the ContentWriter about writing a non-.xnb file. This was caused by [EffectMaterialContent.Effect]( being serialized, since it's an external reference to a non-xnb file. This was an easy fix, I solved it by adding [ContentSerializerIgnore] above it. - Second, there was an error thrown [here]( because the filename of the reference did not begin with the root directory, which was caused by [NormalizeOS]( in ExternalReference, since it changed directory separators in the ExternalReference so the strings didn't match up. Also an easy fix! I Changed that so it does a regular normalize rather than NormalizeOS (do the separators really matter as long as they're consistent? NormalizeOS is now not used anymore).- After that it built fine! However when loading the model it can't find the content reader for ExternalReference&lt;CompiledEffectContent&gt;. This is the hard one :p After digging through the code a bit, I think it should resolve to a regular ExternalReferenceReader, so it can load the file that's referenced (the reader for the effect itself is loaded, so that would work), but I got a bit confused when I saw the content readers include    ``    It seems weird to have a reader for a specific generic type like that, I thought a generic reader should read its content and delegate to the reader that can handle it. In this case I would expect a NamedValueDictionaryReader, an ExternalReferenceReader and a TextureContentReader to handle a type like this, each delegating internally to the next. So my question is if I should make the writer when asked for the runtime reader write out the full name of the type (e.g. ExternalReferenceReader`1[[sometype]]) or make [ContentTypeReaderManager.GetTypeReader]( a bit smarter to use a reader for the outer type when it encounters generics. I really wouldn't go for the first option, but I don't know if the second one is applicable in general (for all generic types). I think we could make it work though, and it would be **a lot** neater. </Description>

    <Description>I'm getting into OpenGL a bit, and to get some hands on experience I'm trying to implement SetVertexBuffers and DrawInstancedPrimitives (takes care of #913) and I was wondering if the PR for that should just go here or in @cra0zy's SDL2 branch (because there might be some annoying conflicts?). I got it working with multiple vertex buffers, but I can't test DrawInstancedPrimitives right now because I'm on Linux (shader compilation). I'll try Windows and instanced drawing tomorrow.

I'm also unsure if instanced drawing is available on all platforms that MonoGame supports. I think it works on ES 2.0 only with a certain extension and I'm not sure about Windows Phone either. Should I do some checks for that? Anyways, that's probably easier to discuss when the PR is up, so tl;dr where should the PR go?

This would allow us to:- have same code for this control between platforms- gain same drag and drop code, Eto.Forms doesn't support drag and drop, Xwt doesNegative side effects?- Pipeline Tool for Windows will need to use WPF since Xwt doesn't support Windows FormsI really wish that I thought of this idea earlier... at least I didn't start writing the new DnD code yet.cc. @tomspilman @KonajuGames @dellis1972 </Description>

    <Description>I've been having issues for months now getting the content to build in my Windows 10 Universal project using the .NET Native toolchain. I recently started a thread on the forums here:I finally tracked the issue down to this line of code: It looks like it's trying to filter out properties on the object that have been hidden using the "new" keyword in C#. Unfortunately, the trick of checking if the GetMethods for the properties are reference equal doesn't seem to work using the .NET Native toolchain. In general, this doesn’t feel like a great way to make this check. The result is that most custom content loads up with blank or null values, which causes crashes elsewhere. For my game, I just commented out that line and everything works fine. I don't do any property hiding, although I'm not sure if things would break outright even if I did. Regardless, I spent some time investigating fixes to the problem and it turns out .NET doesn't really have a great way to determine if one property is hiding another in a base class. Especially in the RT environment where reflection is limited. If possible, it seems like it might be best to not do this check at all. I’m not sure what, if anything, was actually breaking downstream before this check existed. Like I said, my project works fine without it. To find out why this code exists in the first place, I tried to track down the original commit, but haven't had much luck. I think there have been some git history rewrite shenanigans going on. You can see that in this commit ( the logic was moved from ReflectiveReader.cs to ContentExtensions.cs. But if you go through the history of ReflectiveReader.cs, you won't see that commit. Also, I can't find any trace of the property hiding check ever having been in that file. Instead you can see the changed seems to have happened between this commit ( and this commit (TLDR; The check for property hiding is sketchball and breaks .NET Native apps. .NET doesn’t provide a great way to check for this at all. Maybe you should kill it altogether. PS: The GetAllProperties() and GetAllFields() functions are misnamed. They both get very restrictive sets of properties/fields. </Description>

    <Description>I already posted this in the community section at the monogame website, but didn't get an answer yet, so I decided to post it here as well.I tried to install Monogame 3.5 for Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10.The setup throws an error when trying to install the templates. It says "Unable to open file to write" on every Template-ZIP. It also doesn't create the Monogame subfolder in the Visual Studio 2015...\Templates\Visual C# folder.I have administrator rights and executed the setup as administrator. I disabled my Anti-Virus for the installation.The Visual C# folder had the "write protected" setting in the half-checked state that you get when a program is currently using the folder. Visual Studio is not open though and I don't know how to find out which program currently uses the folder.I think I would just need the template ZIP files as download to manually copy them to the folder or a fix for my installer problem.Can I just install the WindowsUniversal.vstemplate from the GIT folder (I won't need the other templates)? How?Edit: I found out that this issue is a copy of [Can't install templates]( I also moved my Libraries to D:\ volume like the creator of that issue.However, my other question about manually installing the templates still stands and I would appreciate an answer.</Description>

    <Description>I don't know if they're documented (I've searched the issues and found nothing, but those could be there and I just didn't find them).- Adding a folder as a link works wrong. Instead of adding the folder, and inside of it, the files it contains, it just adds all files and directories at the same level.- When saving and reloading a project where the previous step has been performed, the containing folder disappears.- When deleting those added files, instead of deleting the link, it tries to delete the file (i.e. in ......\file.png), which can permanently destroy data the user thinks is safe. - When building linked data, the output directory should be defined by the pipeline tool folder structure, not the original place where the linked file is. In example, if the data is in d:\asset and the mgcb file is in d:\mgcb, and I create a directory (in the pipeline tool) named  myXNB, and we create a linked file pointing to d:\asset\mytex.png inside myXNB, the output directory should be myXNB, however the pipeline tool tries to create it at d:\assets\myXNB.xnb- Adding a file as a link just copies it (I'm not sure of it , it my just be a problem masked by the previous issues)</Description>

    <Description>I've started this subjet on twitter : Brief history of my case:- I am trying to make a game based on FNA- I want to try android/ios/xbox one support, so I compile my code with monogame 3.6- And I see these ram conssumption for my game running in debug mode : with FNA +- 100MB and with monogame +-200MBAfter make some tests, monogame memory consumption follow the backbuffer size. In 4k my game eat more than 300MB with monogame and stay at 100MB with FNA. (the others values was in 1080p)I've made a new test with the code output by monogame template, just change the backbuffer size**4k**fna : 50MBMG : 150 MB**1080p**fna : 50MBMG : 93 MB**640x360**fna : 50MBMG : 65 MBDid I forget something ? a parameter ?I know that 3.6 is not a finished version, but I am curious, maybe too much ;)I hope these informations can help or I hope that I've made a mistake.Edit: I use DesktopGL template</Description>

    <Description>Not sure if this also affects OpenGL implementation.The bug is in `private void PlatformGetData&lt;T&gt;(int level, int arraySlice, Rectangle? rect, T[] data, int startIndex, int elementCount)` the `startIndex` parameter is used as in offset in the texture data instead of being an offset for the `data` parameter.To reproduce the bug take any non transparent black texture and use this code``Will do a pull with the fix and the test shortly, but I have to test this a little with different rectangle sizes</Description>

    <Description>Hello,I am trying 3.6 Dev Build with vs2013 or 2015 and the template DesktopGL.- The project is created, perfect.- I press F5, compile, launch the program, and get the message "SDL2.dll missing"- ok, I copy sdl2.dll in my debug folder- Press F5 again and get a "vshost32 stop to run" message (but in french :) )Did I forgot something? I didn't modify the code created by the template. Maybe my sdl2.dll is wrong version (2.0.4.0) ?In my debug folder I've got :- monogame.framework.dll- nvorbis.dll- openTK.dll- openTK.dll.config- test1.exe- test1.exe.config- test1.pdb- test1.vshost.exe- test1.vshost.exe.config- test1.vshost.exe.manifestI have added : sdl2.dll and openal32.dll (to try...)I hope I don't push at open doors and sorry for my english!Thanks for all your joboldteen</Description>

    <Description>For some reason on XB1 via UWP both `VertexBuffer` and `IndexBuffer` fail to work, but `DynamicVertexBuffer` and `DynamicIndexBuffer` work fine.What is particularly curious about this is that things work perfectly fine under UWP on Windows 10 desktops and on UWP under Raspberry Pi.  Also the exact same code works on Windows 7, Vista, and Windows 8.  It is just on XB1 where the non-dynamic buffers fail to work.I suspect it is either something something in buffer setup:Or it is something in the buffer `SetData` which takes a different path for dynamic vs static buffers:  It could very well be that the code that has worked for 5 years now on every other DX platform has been wrong and the drivers and/or the DX runtime has been letting us get away with it.</Description>

    <Description>I have a shader that causes an ArgumentException, "Offset and length were out of bounds for the array or count is greater than the number of elements from index to the end of the source collection."The stack trace is as follows:   at System.Buffer.BlockCopy(Array src, Int32 srcOffset, Array dst, Int32 dstOffset, Int32 count)   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.SetData(Int32 offset, Int32 rows, Int32 columns, Object data)   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.SetParameter(Int32 offset, EffectParameter param)   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.ConstantBuffer.Update(EffectParameterCollection parameters)   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.EffectPass.Apply()After some really low-level probing, I was able to determine that the effect's ConstantBuffer(s) seems to have been incorrectly allocated. My vertex shader has four float4x4 parameters, and as such, the offsets are correctly set as 0, 64, 128, 192. However, the ConstantBuffer's buffer is only 240 bytes, rather than the necessary 256. It looks as though it's reading that sizeInBytes figure from the compiled shader effect code, so does that mean the HLSL compiler is doing something wrong? Or is there something else that I'm overlooking?</Description>

    <Description>I've tried doing mouse drag event handling in both MonoGame base and MonoGame.Extended and for some reason Xamarin.Mac projects do not work as expected while MonoMac projects work fine.  I can capture drag events with the middle mouse button but the right and left mouse buttons do not drag.  I tried this with some XNA drag and drop code I ported, and then further tested with a brand new project using the the MonoGame.Extended InputListener Demo code.  This seems like a bug where the mouse movement events aren't firing for some reason while the button is in a pressed state.  </Description>

    <Description>The DepthBias in MonoGame is not working the same way as in XNA.I'm not 100% sure, but it looks like XNA is applying the DepthBias value set in RasterizerState in a way that matches the depth buffer format.In XNA I have used a value of -0.0004f (this is quite much) to offset a transparent area border above the landscape.This didn't work at all in MonoGame and after some investigation I found out that MonoGame just passes the value to DirectX without modification and DirectX applies it as a factor to a very small number that is calculated based on the depth buffer format.My theory now is that XNA does some math with the DepthBias value to make it easier for the developer to deal with it.In my case (24bit depth buffer) the following formula gives exactly the same visual result as -0.0004f in XNA:`state.DepthBias = (float)(-0.0004f / (1 / Math.Pow(2, 24)))`</Description>

    <Description>When you have to initialize a bunch of colors the current setters and constructors are inefficient.  They all do internal math to scale or clamp values to back to a byte then pack them.  Often this math isn't needed but is there just in case someone passes an out of range value.I suggest extending the API to support two additional constructors directly taking a packed value and channel bytes:``These would be the most efficient constructors one could use.We should also document the packed format in the reference docs on the new ctor and the packed value getter/setter.</Description>

    <Description>Unlike Visual Studio on Windows and Xamarin on Mac, if you install the Linux version (at least by using the Ubuntu install instructions) no project templates install into MonoDevelop so you're stuck using another operating system to create an empty project and then opening that project in Linux.  You should just be able to select a MonoGame template when you create a new MonoDevelop project.This seems like an easy enough fix so I'm happy to try to tackle it myself if nobody else is working on it.</Description>

    <Description>This is something I noticed in XNA behavior porting a game to PS4.If you have a texture that is filled with the color:  `R:255 G:128 B:64 A:0`.  When you load this texture via `Texture2D.FromStream` the resulting texture has the color: `R:0 G:0 B:0 A:0`.If you have a texture that is filled with the color:  `R:255 G:128 B:64 A:1`...  `Texture2D.FromStream` returns a texture with the color: `R:255 G:128 B:64 A:1`.So although the XNA docs for `Texture2D.FromStream` explicitly state that it returns non-premultiplied colors... it does however clear the color channels if the alpha channel is 0.I don't know if MonoGame matches XNA in this regard or not.  We need to implement a specific unit test with a special test texture to verify the results.Secondarily we should consider adding an overload that lets you disable this color channel clearing as it was unexpected.  I can see how it would be useful to not have it modify the loaded color data.</Description>

    <Description>Hi guys,I was wondering if we could just go ahead and implement an interface for the Bounding Frustum/Box/Sphere class, which would dictate stuff like Intersect(), Contain(), etcI don't see any downside and on the upside we can just cast all of these for generic comparisons like ((IBoundingVolume) myBoundingVolume).Contains(myVector3); or (myBoundingVolume as IBoundingVolume) for that matterWhat do you think?</Description>

    <Description>We want to generate the following PCL assemblies for MonoGame:- MonoGame.Framework.Portable- MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.PortableThis involves the following tasks:- Add the latest [Piranha]( executable to the dependencies submodule.- Modify the [default.build]( script to generate the PCL assemblies.- Add NuGet packages for each.- Add the new PCL assemblies to the Windows/Mac/Linux installers.As long as the new PCL assemblies are placed into the `MonoGame.Framework\bin\Portable` and `MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline\bin\Portable` folders the build server will automatically gather it into the build artifacts and copy them around for the various build steps.</Description>

    <CreatedDate>24/03/2016</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>18/04/2016</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hello,First, I should note that I don't know if the problem comes from the `OggStreamer` / NVorbis, OpenAL, or my own code.When playing `Song` for an extended time (from 5 to 10 minutes, and it doesn't matter if it is the same song or a queue of different ones), it happens very often that the `Song` playing volume changes by itself without any call to `MediaPlayer` in the last couple minutes, and it can go from plain 0 to 1.This happens on all platforms, with OpenAL-Soft or Apple/Creative's one, and only affects `Song`, not `SoundEffect`.Our game can be very `SoundEffect` intensive, and `Song` are cross-faded by code. At first I thought that I was putting to much pressure on the OpenAL command buffer, but even adding locks to have a max of 10 AL calls per second doesn't change anything, and the problem can happen in moments when absolutely no `SoundEffect` is playing for several seconds.Any thoughts?</Description>

The column on the right is being rendered from MG as a 150px width box.Now in reality, the box on the right is actually rendered as 75px of "retina pixels". It seems that the window/OpenGL view is not being properly setup. It should take the scale into account when it is created.  This causes a host of problems. All rendering is at 50% of the requested size and then the mouse coordinates are **not** properly scaled so they are 2x off.&lt;img width="752" alt="screen shot 2016-03-18 at 4 40 49 pm" src="The below image shows the mouse position and viewport size while the mouse is in the bottom right corner of the window.</Description>

    <Description>Following a couple tweets with Ethan ( it may be interesting to update `OpenTK.dll.config` (and the future MonoGame.Framework.dll.config once OpenTK is replaced) to look for OpenAL Soft dylib instead of the OS X system library (and then push the dependencies to MonoGame/MonoKickstart, and make sure that it works on XamMac).This would help maintaining the OpenAL implementation across the DesktopGL platforms in the future.I've already seen the Apple implementation having differences (e.g. different return values than oal soft) and some 8-22khz sounds don't render the same than on other platforms.</Description>

    <Description>I have noticed that the SharpDX libraries for Windows UAP are from the alpha release while there's a stable version since Christmas.Would you like to update them for 3.5, or left that for a later version?</Description>

    <Description>I have VS 2015 Update 1 on a brand new Windows 10 machine with the latest Monogame 3.4 installed.When I try to create a new MonoGame Windows 10 UAP Project I get prompted with a message saying that I dont have the right SDK version (this error: Reading on forums it seems that its these two lines that are wrong in the csproj file:    TargetPlatformVersion 10.0.10069.0 TargetPlatformVersion    TargetPlatformMinVersion 10.0.10069.0 TargetPlatformMinVersionUpdating these to 10.0.10586.0 makes me able to load the project but I am then stuck with 197 errors waiting to be fixed.Is this a bug in monogame, or something I have done wrong? I'm sitting here with a Lumia 950 and want to get coding :)</Description>

    <Description>Long story short:1) We could add perplatform stuff more easily without having to resort to:2) Why is there an AllowUserResizing property on Android? Ok, we are keeping that for XNA compatibility, but still, does make a point, we could potentially disable stuff that doesn't work on specific platforms.CC. @dellis1972 @KonajuGames @tomspilman </Description>

    <Description>The stable 3.4 version keeps the game running in background after performing Exit() or by closing the windows. If you add a breakpoint on the Exit() and skip it, the game will stop after a while.It occurs even in a new empty solution.I have tried the daily build but this version seems broken as the windows.xna.framework seems unreachable...Feel free to ask me more details.Thanks ans regards.</Description>

    <Description>Setting of Window.Title in e.g. the Initialize method has no effect in a Universal Windows project.It does work though in a Windows OpenGL project, so I reckon it has to do with the UWP SDK.So steps to reproduce:1. Open Visual Studio2. Create new project choosing "MonoGame Windows 10 Universal Project"3. In Game1.Initialize set Window.Title to "My Title";4. Run the app, and we expect the window title to be "My Title" while it is in fact still the project title.</Description>

    <Description>I wanted to talk about this for a while, but always seemed to forget. How about we start using "ImageMagick" for reading images for content Pipeline.Why? Supported formats for one, which include both Gimp(XCF) and Photoshop(PSD) formats:It also has a .NET wrapper: Worst case scenario if we can't actually use it as a replacement for our current method, we could still make it convert the file to some known format for us. I've only ever used it as a linux terminal command.CC. @tomspilman @KonajuGames @dellis1972 </Description>

    <Description>I am trying to convert a project I did in XNA, that I have converted to WindowsDX succesfully, but now when trying to use DesktopGL, while it compiles without changing anything in the code, i'm having the following problems (using latest development installer):- First try to run the game showed that the `OpenAL` installer is included with the installer but not run.- If content is set for Windows platform or DesktopGL I get a `InvalidDataException` from NVorbis.dll with message "Could not determine container type!"- If content is set for DesktopGL it fails to compile a mp3 file with the "lame" codec (it's a different file from the one of the previous post), the other mp3 files workThis is trace when converting the mp3 file:System.InvalidOperationException: ffmpeg exited with non-zero exit code: ffmpeg version N-63930-g1c5aa64 Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers  built on Jun 12 2014 22:22:05 with gcc 4.8.3 (GCC)  configuration: --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --disable-w32threads --enable-avisynth --enable-bzlib --enable-fontconfig --enable-frei0r --enable-gnutls --enable-iconv --enable-libass --enable-libbluray --enable-libcaca --enable-libfreetype --enable-libgme --enable-libgsm --enable-libilbc --enable-libmodplug --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopencore-amrnb --enable-libopencore-amrwb --enable-libopenjpeg --enable-libopus --enable-librtmp --enable-libschroedinger --enable-libsoxr --enable-libspeex --enable-libtheora --enable-libtwolame --enable-libvidstab --enable-libvo-aacenc --enable-libvo-amrwbenc --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx --enable-libwavpack --enable-libwebp --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libxavs --enable-libxvid --enable-decklink --enable-zlib  libavutil      52. 89.100 / 52. 89.100  libavcodec     55. 66.100 / 55. 66.100  libavformat    55. 43.100 / 55. 43.100  libavdevice    55. 13.101 / 55. 13.101  libavfilter     4.  8.100 /  4.  8.100  libswscale      2.  6.100 /  2.  6.100  libswresample   0. 19.100 /  0. 19.100  libpostproc    52.  3.100 / 52.  3.100Input #0, mp3, from 'C:\Users\Arneeklawn\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp344.tmp':  Metadata:    TYER            : 1998-11-17    Engineer        : xx    encoded_by      : dBpoweramp Release 13.3    artist          : Mateo Pascual    album           : Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty  Duration: 00:02:42.46, start: 0.050113, bitrate: 134 kb/s    Stream #0:0: Audio: mp3, 22050 Hz, stereo, s16p, 133 kb/s    Metadata:      encoder         : LAME3.98r[libvorbis @ 0000000004c5a2c0] encoder setup failedOutput #0, ogg, to 'C:\Users\Arneeklawn\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp345.tmp':  Metadata:    TYER            : 1998-11-17    Engineer        : xx    encoded_by      : dBpoweramp Release 13.3    artist          : Mateo Pascual    album           : Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty    Stream #0:0: Audio: vorbis, 0 channels, 128 kb/s    Metadata:      encoder         : Lavc55.66.100 libvorbisStream mapping:  Stream #0:0 -&gt; #0:0 (mp3 (native) -&gt; vorbis (libvorbis))Error while opening encoder for output stream #0:0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate, rate, width or height   en Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Audio.AudioContent.ConvertFormat(ConversionFormat formatType, ConversionQuality quality, String saveToFile)   en Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Processors.SongProcessor.Process(AudioContent input, ContentProcessorContext context)   en Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.ContentProcessor`2.Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.IContentProcessor.Process(Object input, ContentProcessorContext context)   en MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Builder.PipelineManager.ProcessContent(PipelineBuildEvent pipelineEvent)</Description>

    <Description>When DesktopGL games are launched from Steam, a couple issues can happen (tested on Windows only):- mouse coordinates have the top left corner of the screen for origin when using windowed mode;- `Viewport` (or possibly the backbuffer) size is 50% smaller (most probably related to the DPI issue);This is not related to the overlay. Launching the exact same build from the install folder instead of the Steam client resolves these issues.</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I plan to refactor how `SoundEffectReader` constructs `SoundEffect`s.  Currently there is this crappy `#ifdef` in there:Looking at it closer it seems to do nothing that couldn't be done within `SoundEffect` itself.My strategy is to add an internal constructor that also passes the `format` into `SoundEffect` when it is not a PCM format.  Internally this would call an platform initialization method that takes a format.  This allows for platform specific audio formats to work as well as formats like PCM.</Description>

    <Description>The new filter view in the Pipeline tool should have additional options to allow you to actually filter content.  - Show/hide skipping.- Show/hide successful content builds.- Show/hide warnings.- ???Without something like this the filter view is just a more verbose version of the current output window.</Description>

    <Description>There are a bunch of issues I noticed when using the MonoGame Pipeline tool on Windows.  Some of this might be Windows specific... some of it might apply the to GTK frontend as well.- We should include the open project name in the title bar (see VS).- It isn't obvious if a content build is active occurring.- We lost the build succeeded/failed message and build time at the end of the output log.- The control border around the filter view is different that that around the output view.- The output and filter views fights the user set scrollbar position.- Text selection in the output view doesn't work correctly.- The filter view should have buttons to allow you to filter stuff out... like not showing skipping messages.- The 'References' property value should show a `;` separated string of assembly names.- Undo/Redo should be visible on the toolbar.- Toolbar icons do not update to disabled when a build is triggered.</Description>

    <CreatedDate>23/01/2016</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>09/02/2016</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Windows (with 4K displays) and OS X (with Retina displays) are using a high DPI mode which scales everything to fit high resolutions.OpenTK has internal mechanisms to handle that automatically, but MonoGame overrides the `Viewport` size (because it assumes it to be the same as the backbuffer, which is not correct when it comes to DPI scaling) and this results in cropped or too big viewport.I know that OpenTK is being replaced, but I feel like this is still an important issue and I'm leaving this here so we can keep that in mind when SDL2 will be in use (note that SDL2 &lt;= 2.0.2 doesn't have DPI scaling support).</Description>

    <Description>I have a skinned fbx model which renders perfectly using BasicEffect. But as soon as I select the SkinnedEffect in the pipeline tool (and in my code), it turns completely black. (using default lighting, specular power 16 and white color).On my previous laptop it worked perfectly, but now for some reason it doesn't want to render properly anymore. I've tried to run it on another pc, but sadly I'm getting the same result. This laptop supports DX12 so that shouldn't be a problem.When I use alphablend BlendState the model doesn't render at all. And when I use opaque, it renders black.I'm using the latest code from the development branch.Could this be a bug? Or is there something I should supply to the SkinnedEffect to make it work.I can supply more info if needed, but I hope someone knows an easy fix for this.</Description>

    <Description>I want to increase the number of bones in the skinnedmodels.cs, and in general I'd like to become able to collaborate in the monogame development. Once I run protobuild and created the dll with visual studio 2015, how can I install the packages in the right directories. Monogame distributions use MonoGameSetup.exe, but I cannot find how I can build it in the Monogame-develop distribution.Thank you,Alessandro</Description>

    <Description>I've only seen this happening on OS X, but given the nature of the problem, I'm pretty sure it can happen on any OS depending on the decoding performance.A crash can occur in `OggStreamer.FillBuffer()` on the `AL.BufferData()` call with an `Invalid Value` AL error.AL documentation about this error:&gt; The size parameter is not valid for the format specified, the buffer is in use, or the data is a NULL pointer. I haven't managed to reproduce it in a debug environment yet, but I'm pretty certain that `size` and `format` are always correct, and that `data` can't be NULL because `CastBuffer()` would throw an exception before the `ALHelper.Check()`. Hence, it most probably mean that a buffer is still in use, though it shouldn't if `AL.SourceUnqueueBuffers()` returned it...UPDATE: got it! I'm testing it before opening a PR.FYI, it is a discrepancy of OpenAL across platforms. `AL.BufferData()` generates this error if the `size` parameter is `0` on OS X, while it does nothing on Windows. Same applies to `AL.SourceQueueBuffers()`.</Description>

    <Description>The most stripped down repro I can come up with is below. This example sets up a DepthStencilState that should only write when the stencil buffer has a 1 in it. So, since nothing at all is ever written to the stencil buffer nothing should ever be end up in the framebuffer. The actual output is that the texture is written to the framebuffer when it should not ever pass the stencil test.``</Description>

Instead `GraphicsDeviceManager` should be creating a new `PresentationParameters` object... populating it with the new state... then passing that to `GraphicsDeviceManager` to become the new presentation state.Some code that currently fails under MonoGame:``</Description>

    <Description>Hello guys,here is a list of issues that happened after the Steam release:1. Game was not working on Arch Linux with MonoGame mono kickstart.   I got with the player and solved the issue. Since Arch Linux have newer libraries this was the issue:   libgif.so.4 =&gt; not found   libpng12.so.0 =&gt; not found   And on Arch Linux he had    libgif.so.7 and libpng16   He added the older libs and the game started working!2. After making it work on Arch Linux, full screen was not working, only very small part of the full screen was showing and the rest was transparent, you could see the desktop. When going in windowed mode it was fine until he reached 1920x1080 window mode resolution.   Also when playing in windowed mode it is not a real window but a black full screen with the game of the windowed mode resolution size.3. I have complaint from 2nd player that the game would not start at all on Windows with ATI GPU, still have to investigate this. A while ago one friend could not start the game at all on different ATI GPU PC.4. Game is not working properly in full screen on 4K monitors and on Mac retina displays. The background is black and the game shows in top left 1/4 of the screen. Switching to windowed mode it works fine. I have added window mode resolutions up to 4K and it works with no issues.Hope you find this helpful and find a quick solution @cra0zy @mrhelmut @tomspilman I will update you as I find more issues or solutions.Thanks,Endi</Description>

    <Description>I have a .mgcb project that references DLLs with custom content processors. When I load the project in the Pipeline tool the first time, I see one entry for each of my custom processors. When I reload the mgcb project (without closing the Pipeline tool), the custom processors are listed twice:![image](I have found the following cause: [PipelineType.cs]( collects the list of processors in [ResolveAssemblies()]( It first collects all processors of the assemblies which are currently loaded in the AppDomain. Then it collect all processors from the custom content pipeline DLLs referenced in the .mgcb.This works the first time, but when the project is reloaded, the custom content pipeline DLLs are already loaded in the AppDomain and ResolveAssemblies() will find the same processors in both loops and add them twice.In my projects this is only a bit irritating but no real problem. But could this be a problem if a user tests several .mgcb projects that use different versions of a custom content processor DLL?A quick fix would be to just ignore duplicate entries. Ideally, we want to unload custom content processor DLLs before loading the next project. However, I think it is currently not possible in .NET to unload DLLs. I think we can only unload whole AppDomains.</Description>

    <Description>`VertexElementFormat.Short4` and `VertexElementFormat.Color` doesn't pass through to shader correctly. Instead, they screw up the vertex input structure entirely, causing other members of the structure also become fancy.These formats must be replaced by `Vector4` (when porting from XNA) to work correctly. At least for `Color`, the vertex declaration can be left defined as is, just the actual vertex buffer data must be passed as `Vector4`. For `Short4` such a test cannot be done, since that also differs in bit-representation from `Vector4`.Platform is DirectX Windows.</Description>

    <Description>In #4403 we discussed about the maximum number of playing sources. It is stated that OS X has a limit of 256 sources and 1024 buffers.However, I'm getting a lot of AL errors on this line: When debugging, there are 16 pooled `SoundEffectInstance` in the `SoundEffetInstancePool` and 0 playing instances.This makes me question the 1024 buffers and 256 sources limits.What is strange, is that the current source limit of 32 seems fine (`OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES`). I already played up to 32 sources simultaneously. But the buffer limit looks to be 16... Could this be possible?I also noticed that while being pooled, `SoundEffectInstance` retain their `OALSoundBuffer` and create a new `OALSoundBuffer` when removed from the pool without clearing / reusing the previous one. Could this be the cause? But the number of 16 buffers still seem pretty low.@cra0zy @dellis1972 Any idea?</Description>

    <Description>Hello,It looks like the maximum of playing instances on all OpenAL platforms is set to 32 (`OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES`).However, this limit is not considered in `SoundEffect` which has its own `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES` set to `int.MaxValue` (DesktopGL) or `256` (XamMac).There is yet another constant in `SoundEffectInstancePool.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES`, but this one is never used. The `SoundEffectInstancePool` size is `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES`.Fix proposal:- set `SoundEffect.MAX_PLAYING_INSTANCES` to `OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES` on all OpenAL platforms and cleaning the duplicated / unused values;P.S.: unless explicitly documented, it is advised to set `OpenALSoundController.MAX_NUMBER_OF_SOURCES` to 32 (most modern hardware do 64, but for compatibility it is safer to stick to 32, and there is no way to query this limit by code).P.S. 2: `MediaPlayer` uses 1 unchecked source too, which means that the limit of 32 is wrong if the real hardware limit is 32 too.</Description>

    <Description>This stems from a discussion started in another PR:It has been over 3 years since we initially investigated sticking with OpenTK in MonoGame.  The OpenTK team at that time promised fixes and renewed development of the library.Since then there have been improvements, but we still suffer problems with OpenTK functionality and need per-platform work arounds at times.Is it finally time to give up on OpenTK?Do we proceed with our own custom binding for SDL2 and OpenGL?What happens to platforms like iOS and Android where we depend on the Xamarin fork of OpenTK for OpenGL access?</Description>

    <Title>Missing public API to query maximum number of game pads</Title>

    <ClosedDate>03/01/2016</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Currently the GamePad API does this internally:``When you call GetState on an index outside the platform's maximum number of game pads, it throws an exception.  However, there's no public API for getting the value of `PlatformGetMaxNumberOfGamePads` (it is fully private), which means there's no way for a game to enumerate the list of supported gamepads without just cycling up to some number (e.g. 16) and catching exceptions.</Description>

    <Description>Hello :)It appears that gamepads are not working out of the box on MacOS. While we didn't had problems with most Linux distro, our Mac users can't use their gamepads (being Xbox360, PS3 or PS4) and the mono console prints "Number of joysticks: 0" when a game is started.Does this have something to do with some missing dependencies?

    <Description>hello,I'm trying to get working a pixel shader that works perfectly in windows phone, windows (directx), windows 8 and android, but on iOS seems to be some kind of mistake when I pass a texture as parameter on ios, does not throw any error at runtime, simply it don't get the texture. I also tried with the last sources of monogame from github.my pixel shader:``The result should be:![image](but I only get a black box... I also tried to directly return the texture color on the shader without parameter to be sure that the shader is applied and it works, the problem seems to be the texture as parameter.As I said, it works on Android, Windows Phone and Windows using DX monogame, but does not on IOS (tried on emulator, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6)Thanks</Description>

    <Description>Just creating an issue here based on discussion with @tomspilman in #4343.  Basically there was an issue where someone changed something and it broke the Xamarin.Mac implementation but not the MonoMac implementation.  Right now, the MonoGame build server doesn't have the latest version of Xamarin Mac installed.I think the path forward looks something like this:- Get an open source license of Xamarin Mac installed on the MonoGame build server- Add some command line flag like `--force-mac-api-version MonoMac` to Protobuild- Add build targets to test it- Only ship one of these implementations in NuGet etc, because the whole API-breaking by Xamarin is a silly mess and we'll end up with 3 NuGet packages for different Mac APIs otherwise</Description>

    <Description>When using XNA, `Game.Window.ClientBounds` returns the desktop location of the upper-left corner of the client area (i.e. the internal area of a window which doesn't include window borders, title bar, etc).But in the Windows and WindowsGL builds, MonoGame is currently always returning (0, 0). There are likely more builds also affected (very likely Linux, maybe others).I have a fix for the Windows (DirectX) build and I will submit a PR for this shortly.However, I am not sure of the fix for WindowsGL / DesktopGL builds. I took a quick look into it, but could not see how to obtain the same position via the OpenTK INativeWindow interface. It only seems to give the desktop location of the entire window (including borders, etc). I could not find a way getting the desktop location of the internal client area.</Description>

    <Description>Hi guys.I was just wondering if a PR for adding the `&lt;MonoGamePlatform&gt;` and `&lt;Import&gt;` elements to the project files automatically is something that I could do? Each time I install MonoGame into a new project, I have to manually edit the files and add it. Not too hard, but very annoying. We can do this automatically without any strange scripts and things. Basically, according to the [docs]( we can add a `.props` file that adds the `&lt;MonoGamePlatform&gt;` element based on the NuGet installed. As each NuGet has a single platform, there will be no confusion. Then, we just add the `.targets` file to the NuGet and it will automatically be referenced.I have done this with several projects, and is very useful. It works in Visual Studio, Xamarin Studio/MonoDevelop. If anything fails, such as some random IDE, it can still be added manually.</Description>

    <Description>This code works in Windows version: songs = new Dictionary&lt;string, XSong&gt;(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; soundManagerInit.songs.Count; i++) {         XSong song = new XSong();         song.InitXSong(soundManagerInit.songs[i]);         song.Song = game.Content.Load&lt;Song&gt;(@"sounds\songs\" + song.FileName);         songs.Add(soundManagerInit.songs[i].name, song);  }and song plays withMediaPlayer.Play(songs["Battle March"].Song);but in Windows GL the Load gives the following error: Specified stream is not a wave file.the only difference is a reference to the appropriate version.Is there a different way to do this in the GL version.</Description>

    <Description>I am proposing the full removal of the existing storage classes:- [StorageContainer.cs](- [StorageDevice.cs](- [StorageDeviceHelper.cs](Back in  I was suggesting redesign, but really after seeing more console SDKs and how each one uses a different method for storage (as well as different TRC requirements)...  it seems better to just drop support for this old API entirely.Then at a later date if we can work out something that works in all cases we can talk about adding a new API.So is anyone using this functionality?  Would it be missed at all?</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Would it be possible to implement move and resize events for the main game as currently there is no way of identifying the position or size of the window. I have seen you push this away before putting the user at fault due to design issues however I can't see how I would get it to work without.Basically I am trying to make a border-less desktop window that you can resize and position to your liking. I would then be using the SwapChainRenderTarget to have multiple windows displayed in parallel with the initial game window. I would finally need to track the position of the central window as then I could have it manage all user input without having to push input events from other window hosts and all I would have to check is if any window I own has focus. This would work fine as monogame isn't concerned about focus so assuming I can position the windows internally for input handling all should be good.Kind Regards,Andy A</Description>

    <Description>Hello,Despite [the null check]( it may happen that `MediaPlayer.SetChannelVolumes()` raise an exception because of the async nature of Media Foundation (Windows DirectX projects).Two different (but related to the same problem) exceptions can occur.1) [On this line](``Situation 1 happens when the `_volumeController` is not yet ready.Situation 2 happens when the `_volumeController` gets reset past the null check (i.e. a new session started but didn't went through the whole initialization yet).Both are related to the async nature of starting a new session.This problem rarely occurs, over thousands of sessions, we had 4 of these crashes reported.@MichaelDePiazzi May I have your thoughts on this one? Every async initializaiton should be fine, I'm quite puzzled.</Description>

    <Description>The issue only occurs on OpenGL (DirectX works fine). Steps to reproduce:- Start the game- Create a second instance of the game in separate AppDomain (`AppDomain.ExecuteAssemblyByName` on the same MonoGame project/executable).- Close the newly created instance- Mouse clicks will no longer be registered on the open window (`Mouse.GetState().LeftButton` always returns `ButtonState.Released`).I suspect this may be an upstream issue with OpenTK -- especially since AppDomains don't sandbox native objects. Any insights?</Description>

    <ClosedDate>13/11/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hello,It appears that `Song` playback doesn't work on Windows Vista. We have several reports of this exception:``Since we can't debug on users' machines, I don't have a more precise stack trace with the native debug messages.According to this [SharpDX discussion]( Windows Vista runs a different Media Foundation version and may require an update. However, after redirecting users to the mentioned update, nothing changes and most users report that the update won't even install.At first I thought it was related to #4176 but I can confirm it isn't.The problem seems very rare, given that Vista users are now very few. There are merely a couple referenced occurrences of that problem on the internet.My best guess would be that the current version of SharpDX targets a Media Foundation version incompatible with Windows Vista.This problem, added to #4176 and the recent difficulties to rework DirectX `Song` playback make me wonder if it would be interesting to switch to another API, at least for the Windows Desktop platform (the other Windows platforms are most probably not affected by Media Foundation dependencies).</Description>

It looks like there are two viable solutions, one is to compile a new openal-soft library and use the new functions to pause suspend/pause the device when necessary. Another would be a fully managed mixer. Either way, this is a big blocker for anyone pushing games to production on Android, and we hope for a final solution soon :)</Description>

    <Description>Hi all,I've noticed an issue with SpriteBatch rendering on WindowsGL platform (does not occur on Windows DX nor XNA 4.0). When drawing a sprite that moves at constant speed, the animation "stutters" and is not smooth, even though the program runs at 60fps. It seems that sometimes the draw is delaye or something.Here's a very simple example to reproduce the bug (the texture red is just a 64x64 red texture):``I've reproduced it Monogame 3.4 and also with the last unstable version (currently 3.5.0.703). I also tried on 2 different computers, same problem with both.Thanks in advance!Martin</Description>

    <Description>I've recently been profiling my game a bit (using CLRProfiler) to try and find code generating excess garbage, and I came across the following from MonoGame (this is from the heap allocation graph):![profile1](I took a closer look at the method in question and found that there was some LINQ being used which seemed to be the culprit:``![profile2](I looked at UpdateMouseState also, but these allocations seemed to be coming from the .NET Framework itself so I assume there's not much that can be done about that.If I'm correct about this, I'm more than happy to submit a PR. I just thought I'd raise an issue first to see what others thought as I'm fairly new to reducing garbage generation (my C# experience so far was mainly in business software dev).</Description>

    <Description>In testing this weekend, i spun up the old XNA CustomModel sample project.This takes a basic FBX model, extracts the underlying vertex data so it can be worked on inside a Gaming project.However, when you try this in a MonoGame solution, the following error is generated:Could not find ContentTypeReader Type. Please ensure the name of the Assembly that contains the Type matches the assembly in the full type name: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ReflectiveReader`1[[Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Graphics.MaterialContent, MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline, Version=3.5.0.652, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]] (Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.ReflectiveReader`1[[Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Graphics.MaterialContent, MonoGame.Framework.Content.Pipeline]])So it looks like MG is missing a Content Pipeline reader for MaterialContent.</Description>

    <Title>Thumbstick inputs being clipped when using circular deadzone</Title>
    <CreatedDate>07/10/2015</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>26/10/2015</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I've been working on improving and fine-tuning controller input for my game recently, and I've noticed when using the circular deadzone setting that the thumbsticks feel a bit too touchy.After doing some investigation, I found that the method being used in MonoGame seems to be incorrect. Here is a graph showing what it's currently doing. The colours represent the resulting thumbstick vector length: Blue = 0 (i.e. the deadzone), Green = Normal range, Yellow = 1 (i.e. full movement)![circular_deadzone_with_circular_gate](So you can see from the big thick yellow area that the values are being clipped. This results in a halfway movement of the thumbstick being equivalent to a full movement. This is not what I'd expect. And looking at Shawn Hargreaves blog article on this subject ( the graphs he provided don't seem to show any clipping being done like this. So I'm assuming this behaviour is actually incorrect.This is my expectation of what the graph should actually look like (which is in line with Shawn Hargreaves graph):![new_method_with_circular_gate](Unless anyone has reason to believe I'm wrong about this, I'm planning to submit a PR soon which corrects this.Also on a related note - While looking into this, I came across the GamePadThumbSticks.Gate property. I can't seem to find this in XNA, so I assume it's been added to MonoGame for some reason? I'm not sure exactly why this setting is needed, but the default for it is GateType.Round (which normalises the thumbstick vector if it's length is greater than 1). So if I set it to GateType.None, then the above graph now looks like this:![circular_deadzone_with_no_gate](Red means that the vector length exceeds the expected maximum of 1. So basically GateType.Round was hiding these out of range values coming from the circular deadzone function.Does anyone know why this Gate property was added to MonoGame? It seems unnecessary as the deadzone setting could be controlling this (ie. GamePadDeadZone.IndependentAxes =&gt; GateType.Square,  GamePadDeadZone.Circular =&gt; GateType.Round, GamePadDeadZone.None =&gt; GateType.None). I have a funny feeling that it might have been added to correct these out of range values, so it might be unnecessary if this was the reason.</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hey there,We are getting a few reports related to sfx which may be dependent to a few sound chip manufacturers.Here are the issues, which may be unrelated, but we highly suspect that they are:1. **Sound corruption**: after playing for an extended time (~1 hour), `SoundEffect` / `SoundEffectInstance` get corrupted. All sounds start to crackle a lot. `MediaPlayer` / `Song` are not affected (which seems normal since `MediaPlayer` uses MediaFoundation and not XAudio2).2. **Freezes / stalls**: when sounds start to crackle, it is almost certain that playing a non pooled `SoundEffectInstance` (i.e. through `SoundEffect.CreateInstance()`) will totally stall the game for several seconds. `SoundEffect.Play()` (i.e. pooled instances) doesn't stall the game.I'm totally puzzled about these issues and we haven't been able to reproduce them internally which makes me think that they are related to specific sound chips and possibly driver issues.It may also be only related to looped `SoundEffectInstance`, because they tend to make the game stall more often/quickly.I also don't know why only non-pooled instances are making the game to stall. I would suspect an hardware instance limit, but since the pool doesn't have a limit on Windows platforms, the problem would have been exposed way before any non-pooled instance is played.I haven't found the time to test that against OpenAL.</Description>

    <Description>Hello! I would like to get the attention of the devs about an issue that currently makes `MouseState` unusable. I'm using the latest dev build of MonoGame, `3.5.0.574`, I believe? So here's an example code:``Above, I am trying to create a custom cursor for my game. But when I debug, the cursor image stays at the `0, 0` coordinates of the screen and won't move. Could the image be the problem? It is a BMP file 32x32 pixels with magenta background for transparency.Why do `Mouse.GetState().X` and `Mouse.GetState().Y` always return `0, 0`? I tested this exact same code in XNA and it worked (although my cursor texture had offset compared to the default windows mouse pointer). In my override methods I call `base.LoadContent(Content);`, `base.Update(gameTime);` and `base.Draw(spriteBatch);` and everything else works except the cursor. Did it work before? What was the default behavior? Can a developer test the issue as well?</Description>

    <Description>Hello,I'd like to reopen this issue with some proof that CompositionTarget.Rendering is totally broken on WP8.1 (and WP10 at some extent)- Using VS2013, crete new Visual C# -&gt; Store Apps -&gt; Universal Apps project. Blank App- Add function to MainPage.xaml.cs    ``- Run on WP8.1 device (mine is Nokia 920 , latest firmware update).Tapping the button will print the number of times Rendering has been called- Now mash the screen with all fingers, tapping and dragging. Admitely it takes some more time than MonoGame to crash, but I can make it crash in 10-15 seconds- Now tap the button. Tap no longer works.OK, now the weird part. I was writing this message to show the evilness of CompositionTarget.Rendering, affecting touch, adding a huge delay to screen rotation, increasing global warming and in WP10 I think it's the culprit that sometimes randomly the touch locations are 'portrait' when should be 'landscape'.  When I thought... this is weird, I can't see why subscribing to CompositionTarget can affect this.So, at the previous message I removed everything related to CompositionTarget, and incremented the counter each time the button was pushed. Guess what? WP8.1 still stops receiving touches.So, creating a simple XAML app, adding a button, and mashing, makes the button (and all touch) stop working in my Nokia 920.So, my question is... is it just an issue with my Nokia 920 or is somebody else able to reproduce this problem? Because it seems that everything with XAML in it is freezing when mashing the screen in WP8.1 mode (not a problem in WP8.0) EDIT: I've seen several WP8.1 only games freezing under those conditions, and apparently not using MonoGame at all, which would confirm that everything-XAML based on my Nokia 920 is affected by this problem.</Description>

    <Description>Each WMV video played would leak about 75MB of memory, rapidly increasing the amount used by the software, with disposing the videos doing nothing, even after PlatformDispose was uncommented in Video.cs.I spent a while looking into it and came to the conclusion that the cleanup process wasn't being handled correctly; MediaFoundation documentation at  describes an asynchronous process of closing the session that needs to be done before the media source, then session is disposed. I couldn't find any documentation for disposing media sources without closing the session they had been used with.I came up with a first draft for a set of changes to fix this, using #4090's work on MediaPlayer as a starting point, which move the MediaSession into the Video class and have a MediaSession per video, which is closed, followed by disposal of the rest of the resources, when the video is disposed. They also dispose events received by our callback class, since not doing so causes the leak to persist, which is something that likely wants to be incorporated in any fixes to MediaPlayer's disposing of resources, too. The changes are at  but this isn't suitable to merge because of some remaining issues I encountered while working on it:- The TaskScheduler-based dispatching to the UI thread used in #4090 didn't seem to be working right for me, it was running things on the thread pool, so I had to incorporate the same approach to passing tasks off to the UI thread used on Android. I suspect this could have been caused in some fashion by the particular product I was testing with, though.- Because it needs to invoke to the UI thread several times to raise events before the video enters the playing state after a call to PlatformPlay, the loop waiting for the session to enter the playing state in Play always fails. I'm not sure the best way to deal with this, but this might not be a problem if the above is fixed since it sleeps in Play and .NET pumps the message queue while sleeping/blocked on a lock by default.(In our own fork I worked around this by adding a PlayAsync method to VideoPlayer.cs, which dropped the loop-and-sleep-until-state-changed behaviour entirely, since it was desirable to make things smoother anyway by letting the rest of the program continue while the video setup happened, but this didn't fix the XNA compatible API and I've not included it in the linked branch.)</Description>

    <Description>Hey there,We are testing our game against several configurations and it appears that gamepads are no more working on Windows 7 and Vista (DirectX target).They are correctly installed but are not detected in MonoGame. There is no crash related to any XInput version mismatch. The game works correctly but gamepad can not be pooled.Installing a previous DirectX redist (XInput 1.3) doesn't change this.My wild guess is that SharpDX loads XInput 9.1.0 (compatibility mode) if it can't find XInput 1.4 (Win8) and that the 9.1.0 is lacking some features useful to MonoGame.Or am I missing a dependency?EDIT: may be related to #3240 (and just noticed that I already pop'd that discussion over there...).</Description>

    <Description>It seems like at least these three are done:&gt; - The MonoGame 2.x series is now in maintenance mode.&gt; - MonoGame 3.0 will mark the start of full support for the entire XNA API.&gt; - The Content Pipeline is currently under development. This will allow compiling of assets to optimized formats for the MonoGame supported platforms in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop without requiring XNA Game Studio 4.0 installed.It would be great to mention the status of the official PCL package which is in pre-release and a couple of releases behind:  It is not immediately obvious what is the plan even based on the discussion #3405 (which is lengthy).</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hello there,For our coming title, we are using licensed assets and their license obliges us to "not make the assets easily readable from the game files". Which means that we are contractually bound to obfuscate in some sort a few files. While XNB packaging/compression is fine for most asset types, it isn't for Song, because this type of assets is not embedded in XNB.Since it's something out of the scope of the original XNA, I would like to have your opinion if that would make a good feature to add to MonoGame. It isn't a trivial task so if not, we'll most likely don't bother integrating that feature deeply into MonoGame and just do some custom encryption of song files on platforms where they can be browsed.</Description>

On Windows, WP8.1 Simulator:   The content ouside the redner tagert will just be clipped ( The first result in below image)2. On WP8.1 real device:   All of contents on such viewport can be shown on the target, but  are shrinked even if all the contents are in the render target bound. I guess, the viewport will be shrinked first, and then content on it.. ( The second result in below image)So it is the issue of Monogame or it is desided by actual GPUs on the devices?![Figure](</Description>

Once done that, all subsequent taps are reported as Pinches  (press back on the phone to clear all the taps and see the problem better)I know this is not a common case (running at 1 FPS with multiple fingers) but may bring evidence of other problems. I was testing #3316 in windows 10 and I randomly found this. Feel free to delete this issue if you feel it's just too picky :)There's also a huge delay between the tap is done and the tap is notified to the app (even at ~1FPS)BTW, what is the correct term? Windows 10 mobile? UWP mobile? Windows Phone 10?</Description>

Take a look at this code:The `List&lt;T&gt;.Sort(...)` there takes a delegate as it shows in the doc:This means on each batch sort we are allocating a delegate to pass to the sort then throwing it away.Not sure if this can be fixed by allocating the delegate and storing it or if we should use one of the other overloads for `Sort` which doesn't generate garbage.</Description>

    <Description>Hi there,I am having problems adjusting the volume of songs while playing. I noticed that it works fine with the first Song played after app launch, but any subsequent song played can't have their volume changed (with the exception of `MediaPlayer.Volume = 0.0f` which correctly totally mutes the song).Platform: WinDX.Possible related issues: #3884EDIT: it seems to be a problem with the `MediaSession` and `MediaFactory.GetService(session, MediaServiceKeys.StreamVolume, AudioStreamVolumeGuid, out volumeObj);`. If I force the recreation of a new `MediaSession` at each play, it works. So it looks like there is a problem with retrieving the correct `AudioStreamVolume` for the given song stream. Most probably related to the fact that topology updates are async (and therefore still bound to the previous stream somehow when trying to retriever the stream volume controller).Most XAudio2 media session impletations seem to re-create a session at every play because media session updates are async. So if you guys are OK with that, I can submit a PR that Shutdown media sessions upon stop and start a fresh one upon start.It is also because of those async initialisations that getting the audio stream volume controller may fail (and needs to wait). I can clean that up and init it once the topology is correctly set (you can know that with the MediaEvent callback).Let me know if that sound coherent.</Description>

    <Description>Hello there,I encountered a few issues with the lighting features of the BasicEffect and its relation to the Model Processor of MonoGame.1. The BasicEffect lighting does not seem to apply correct (tested with the EnableDefaultLighting), it just casts the same light on all parts of the model, ignorning direction. This might be directly related to 2. The Model Processor seems to somehow mess up normals of the model (or something else related to lighting, I am not sure). This causes light applied by the BasicEffect to look the same for the entire model and appear black.I have an illustration of this occurence here, compared to XNA's output:![wxpsjlt]((Also, on that note, GraphicsDeviceManager.PreferMultiSampling does not seem to prefer multi sampling, it is activated on all models on those screenshots above, but does not seem to apply in MonoGame [yes, GraphicsDeviceManager.ApplyChanges() has been called]).</Description>

In this case we need a v3.0 link in/Library/Frameworks/MonoGame.framework but we also needsome links in the Mono.framework as well.We also need to add an Imports element to the csproj files.Now the current MonoDevleop/Xamarin Studio templating systemdoes not support doing this directly. So a new MSBuildprocessing class has been added to the addin. This classwill check if the project is a "MonoGame" project (is referencesMonoGame.Framework.dll or has a MonoGamePlatform element) andinject the required data into the csproj.The templates have been left referencing the Nuget packagesfor now.Modified the ContentBuilder targets file to Batch its itemsthis is to get round issues when running under xbuild on Mac.Updated templates to use a new MonoGameInstallDirectory propertyrather than $(MSBuildProgramFiles32) so that we can use thesame paths for references.It also adds the followiing to the projects``So that we can resolve the directory correctly on both WindowsMac and Linux</Description>

    <Description>Hey MonoGame team,I'm working on [MonoGame.Extended]( which provides/will provide extensions such as cameras, GUI, etc, and ran into an interesting issue. We are compiling our core library as a PCL against the MonoGame PCL available on Nuget, and this limits us to old versions of MonoGame (the most recent being v3.2.99.1-Beta, two major versions behind). Many changes have been made since then, and even being able to use v3.4 would be a ton better. Can I get some directions on how to build MonoGame as a PCL, and/or an update to the Nuget package?</Description>

    <Description>PR #4010 has caused a regression - Sound effects no longer work under Windows 7 (for the DirectX build).Further investigation reveals that SoundEffect(.XAudio).InitializeSoundEffect was swallowing an exception about being unable to load "xaudio2_8.dll". I found a post on the SharpDX forums discussing this issue ( Long story short - It seems you need to use the DirectX11 SharpDX libraries for Windows 7. The DirectX11.1/11.2 libraries don't seem to be fully supported under Windows 7.I did a quick hack to prove this by copying the SharpDX 2.6.3 DirectX11 libraries in. I also had to revert the changes made to SoundEffect.XAudio.cs after I did this to get it compiling. Sound effects started working again with these changes.I'm more than happy to make a pull request for this.

    <Description>## IntroductionFirst of all I want to point out that this issue may be more important than you may think at first because it may happen in every monogame, even if it's pure 2D. Even worse, a usual player that owns 3D Vision may not even have the idea that the graphic glitches he is seeing may be related to 3D Vision, he forgot to deactivate.## SymptomsSo now for the issue itself. After experiencing random graphic glitches I wrote a sample code as simple as possible (see below). In order to run it you will need1. a new plain Windows Desktop monogame project2. a resource file named "pixel.xnb" which is a 2D-Texture that simply contains a single black pixel.What it does is to draw a horizontal black line with a height of 5 pixels on a white background and move it vertical in steps of 5 pixels every frame. Works perfectly with 3D Vision deactivated but if 3D Vision kicks in the following happens:![timingglitch](It turned out that it was impossible to get a regular screenshot from the glitch, so I needed to take a photograph of my screen. So please ignore the unsharp grey stripes - they are a side-effect of taking a photograph of the screen and not really there. What is the real glitch are the 3 thin horizontal lines, there only should be one, which is the lowest of them.If you could see the movement: The glitch lines appear to be flickering (I think about 20 times/second, see my theory below). But taking a video of the glitch is even more impossible (120 Hz video camera, anyone? :D ). Then the glitch lines change their position at random points of time.Looking through my 3D glasses it appeared that the glitch lines are only in the half-picture intended for the right eye, the left eye looks normal.## Theory After some research about the internal workings of DirectX graphics and how Monogame uses it I came up with the following theory how this happens:1. Monogame creates a swapchain in the video memory which consists of a screen buffer and 2 back buffers2. since 3D Vision needs 2 half-pictures it creates secondary buffers for the right eye. It doesnt tell the application anything about that (wouldn't be possible with older 3D games that are automatically converted into stereo 3D)3. When a Frame should be drawn, Monogame sends draw instructions to the graphics card and waits until they are executed, then presents the next buffer in the swapchain.4. Monogame (or SharpDX?) uses some unusual way to determine when the draw operations are finished. At least I assume it must be unusual since I never noticed the same problem in other 3D games. The call returns when the first buffer has been drawn, the secondary buffer has not yet been drawn.5. Under normal circumstances the next Frame is drawn now. If that happens the preceding draw operations are cancelled. The secondary buffer remains unchanged.6. only at random times (for example when the operating system gives cpu time to another thread or process) the graphics card is given enough time to execute the drawing operations for the seondary buffer. Then the secondary buffer is changed.7. The screen is presented with the contents of the primary and secondary buffers. Since the secondary buffer contains an old version of the drawing from some random point of time in the past, a flickering ghost will appear. Since there are 3 secondary buffers it flickers at a rate of      120 Hz / 2 (half pictures/second) / 3 (buffers/half-picture) = 20 Hz      There are up to 3 ghosts, because we have 3 secondary buffers.## WorkaroundTo test my theory I just gave the graphics card more time to finish by adding a Thread.Sleep() to the draw cycle. To test remove the slashes from the line `Thread.Sleep( (int)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds/8);` in my code sample. I found the appropriate amount of time with trial and error, it may be system dependent.On my system this removes all the graphic glitches.## Suggestions for SolutionThe second best solution would be to deactivate 3D Vision in Monogame completely. There is an API (nvapi.dll) that allows game developers to control 3D vision, so Monogame would need to check wether it is present and make the appropriate calls.The best solution would be of course to fix the source of the problem since this would allow to write 3D-vision compatible games with Monogame.## Code``</Description>

    <Description>This bug is in the WinDX platform layer, I haven't looked at the others yet.If you want to repro it the way I found it, it's also _really_ obscure, but the fact that it can happen at all is bad enough, right?I was mucking around with what was left of the project template, and the call to Game.Exit ended up on the main code path. Imagine``I assumed that Thread.Sleep was unlikely to be the cause of the infinite loop, so I looked at WinFormsGameWindow.cs. Looking at RunLoop(), there's only one call to Thread.Sleep, and it's inside [this loop](Compared to the loop above it, it simply seems to lack `Application.DoEvents()` to actually pull out messages from the queue, but I have not tested this yet. I'm not sure why this seemingly never caused any issues before, but I assume calling Exit on the first update doesn't give the first loop enough time to clear the queue, and the queue would usually be empty anyway, unless the the hosting process is disabled?But that's just conjecture. Unless one of the devs thinks it's obvious enough and fixes it themselves, I'll try and fix this myself and make a pull request later today or maybe tomorrow.</Description>

    <Description>I have on occasion had a build be abruptly canceled with no feedback to me that it occurred, or any error messages. In fact it looks as if it is still building, perhaps hanging within an individual processor. However that is not what is actually happening. Actually it isn't even building anymore, since the 'build' menu item is enabled and 'cancel' is disabled. I do not know how to reliably reproduce this issue but it happens to me from time to time, and building again will skip past what is already built and start on the next item, and continue onward as expected this time.</Description>

    <Description>I am having trouble getting controllers working on OS X (10.11).I have tried both an Xbox One controller using the Xone-OSX driver, and a USB PS4 controller using native support. In both cases, `GamePad.GetCapabilities(PlayerIndex.One).IsConnected` returns `false`. I'm not sure how to go about debugging this issue. Any guidance would be appreciated.</Description>

An internal format of type Rgba4 was specified, which is not supported in GL.ES20.- Changed existing graphics capabilities checks when reading in a 2d texture to additionally apply to both iOS and Android platforms.

    <Description>The idea is as follows: There would still be project templates in Visual Studio, except now when a template is selected we would take selected options, and do:``and open the project generated by the tool afterwards.The tool should have a --no-gui option, and with that it just generates a default project with the other arguments it got.Advantages:- same project templates for Visual Studio and MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio- Visual Studio Code support- Easily have advanced options, like if the person wants to use nuget or not  - another idea: ability to have templates/samples and downloading them only in case a project creation is started with them as base- would be able to have Local Copy enabled for MonoDevelop's MonoGame local references without any hacks@dellis1972 @tomspilman @KonajuGames What do you think?</Description>

    <Title>Request for regular "MonoGame Windows (XAML) Project" template (i.e. not for Windows Store)</Title>
    <CreatedDate>19/06/2015</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>01/04/2016</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>This is a feature request and a request for guidance:---In VS2013 there is a "MonoGame Windows Store (XAML) Project" template, which is kind of neat, but it's only there for Windows Store apps.Allowing XAML in this way is very cool (especially for games or tooling that might make heavy use XAML UI elements, etc.).However, developing in "app mode" all the time is super annoying, since (at least in Windows 8.1) it forces you to always run full screen, with a slight delay on opening the app, and no easy way to close the apps (alt+f4 is about as good as it gets, everything else involves mouse, and it's really nice while developing to just be able to press ESC and exit the damn thing, but you can't do it -- App.Current.Exit() doesn't even work anymore, it just minimizes the thing).---1.) Can you please make it easy (i.e. include a project template) for developing a regular Windows desktop application with XAML / Monogame? (i.e. "MonoGame Windows (XAML) Project") -- [or otherwise, if you can provide guidance, and I'm able to figure it out, I could submit a pull request...]2.) It seems this project template is missing all together in VS2015 (other project templates are there, but this one is just plain missing -- might be it's own issue / request, but I thought I'd check here first).3.) Is it possible to support XAML on other platforms as well (i.e. Linux, Android, etc.)?4.) Also, somewhat off-topic (I can log another issue, etc. if you like, but hopefully you can just point me  at some quick guidance here?), but the MonoGame slogan "Write once, play everywhere" seems to not be the default state if you're just using the out-of-the-box templates -- in the sense that, I have to create a new solution for each platform I want to support. -- Is there guidance on how to build a single solution with multiple projects in them that all share the same codebase? -- I thought about putting all my engine code into a portable library, but, it would have to reference the mono game DLLs, so it can't be a portable library... right? -- I suppose I could just add the same source files via "Add as a Link" in all the projects -- even then though, what should I do about the content projects? -- **bottom line: Is there official guidance here?**Thank you! :-)</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>This bug occurs with Windows 8.1 Universal projects and the default Monogame templates running the latest nightly build (6/18/15, as well as 3.4 release builds).We notice that very often on app startup, there is perhaps half a second where the graphics do not take up the full screen. This happens both on the Windows Phone Emulator and on a Lumia 920 test device. We do not see it when creating Windows Phone 8.0 projects, or when running on the desktop.You can see it very clearly in this video:As the app starts up, it first renders to the top half of the screen. After half a second, rendering starts happening like normal.Please let me know if any other information is needed to get a repro of this issue.</Description>

    <CreatedDate>15/06/2015</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>15/06/2015</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>I hope my conclusion of what the issue should be is correct, but to be sure I will elaborate more.As I was searching how to draw strings I found a lot of old methods that have been replaced by the new MonoGame Content Pipeline now. To create a .spritefont file with the Pipeline is pretty straightforward and gives no problems, but then it needs to be loaded.Using content.Load&lt;SpriteFont&gt; throws a NotImplementedException because this leads to a call to ReadRasAsset, which throws that exception when the Type is SpriteFont (with a contruction of a SpriteFont in comment).If I am correct this means that there is no way to load SpriteFonts at the moment and as you need a SpriteFont to draw a string it is also impossible to draw text at the moment. Thus it is important that this is implemented soon.Looking at the created .spritefont file however I wonder if the SpriteFont class is meant to be abolished.  I thought this because it states &lt;Asset Type="Graphics:FontDescription"&gt;, leading me to think that the type is to be changed to FontDescription. This type does not exist yet however. I was not able to find anything about this possible change however.Finally I'm sorry if I just misunderstood the way drawing strings must be done now and I simply addressed problems that are not there. I would like to hear so if this is the case however.</Description>

    <Description>Creating the SpriteBatch in the constructor method right after the GraphicsDeviceManager throws an exception.``Does MonoGame allows this? Then a workaround must be found to correct this (e.g. update the GraphicsDeviceManager earlier so the object state is available).Otherwise if it's not allowed then a meaningful exception message could be written so user can be informed about the situation.(i.e. Please initialize SpriteBatch only on LoadContent method)Thanks.P.S.

graphics.SupportedOrientations = DisplayOrientation.Portrait;


sceen width will be the height and viceversa.
Example: on a 800x480 device a normal portrait resolution would be 480x800 but MonoGame leaves width = 800 and height = 480 stretching the content to fit the screen size.

I managed to solve the problem using this:


    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Allows the game to perform any initialization it needs to before starting to run.
    /// This is where it can query for any required services and load any non-graphic
    /// related content.  Calling base.Initialize will enumerate through any components
    /// and initialize them as well.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    protected override void Initialize()
    {
        // TODO: Add your initialization logic here
        int temp = graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth;
        graphics.PreferredBackBufferWidth = graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight;
        graphics.PreferredBackBufferHeight = temp;
        graphics.SupportedOrientations = DisplayOrientation.Portrait;
        graphics.ApplyChanges();
        base.Initialize();

    <Description>Hello,I installed Monogame 3.3 on fresh install of Visual Studio 2013 and I created Monogame Windows Project. After build and start I got an error that dependency is missing (SharpDX). So I used NuGet, it downloads latest version of SharpDX (2.6.3). After start, app throws exception:Could not load file or assembly 'SharpDX, Version=2.5.1.0Why monogame strictly dependent on version 2.5.1.0? By the way, there is no package in NuGet with that version and very close version 2.5.0 not working.Current workaround is to add reference to SharpDX libraries located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoGame\v3.0\Assemblies\Windows\".</Description>

    <Title>Official repo for MonoGame extensions ?</Title>

    <ClosedDate>02/05/2017</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Some people are conservative and dont like new classes or method etc.. but some peoples do not. The good examples of thing to be implemented are PrimitiveBatch,Circle,animation classes for skinned model,BumpMapEffect. I agreed there is too much things for single framework library - So a good variant is to create separate repo for all extensions.Here is few notes... I suggest1) (most important)Link it with the official website of MonoGame and mark it visible(it must be official repo by MonoGame creators, otherwise nobody cares about it).2) It must work on all platforms3) It must be easy to install and use.4) No extension methods(because it is messy and could conflicts with other libs). Use static classes with Ex ending.5) (maybe)Divide it on separate assemblies(for peoples who does not need full functionality).The main problem could be less developer activity and error checking for the first time. But I think the benefits of this repo will be huge(raw MonoGame couldnt do so much from a box) in the future.PS. I heard either @dellis1972 or @KonajuGames saying they have some sort of repo - but this is not be completed without regard of 1) rule.Share your ideas :)</Description>

    <Description>One suggestion to keep your frame rate steady is to adapt resolution on the fly.This technique doesn't work with monogame. The first frame after changing resolution is wrong because the swapchain/Window size doesn't sync with Present. I think we have to record a size change and wait until next Present() to apply it. Probably also separate execution paths that end up to CreateSizeDependentResources based on whether the change comes from a rotation (external) or from the code (internal).The following code swaps between 1 &amp; 1/2 scale every frame.&gt; ``The first screenshot is half the size while it should scale up and fill the window and look  low res.The opposite is also true, if you start with x0.5 scale and change to x1 the next frame is the upper-left 1/4 of your game zoomed in.The second screenshot is Photoshoped to show how the game looks like, in realilty there is flicker.![scaletohalf](![psed](</Description>

Sometimes it takes a while, but sometimes crashes at the first run.I haven't been able to reproduce it in a 2 months old snapshot, but it may be due to crash randomness.</Description>

Instead I'm getting an blue window, running this example on WinGL yields the expected results. Removing the rentertarget swap or adding also "fixes" the problem:

Expected result (if the rendertarget isn't changed or by running on WinGL):

However if the rendertarget swap occurs the image will quickly flash and then nothing gets renderered. It appears that the current samplers state aren't getting properly apply.

Adding the following line after setting the shader parameters "fixes" the issue:

 C#
GraphicsDevice.Textures[1] = null;
`</Code>
    <Description>It appears to be an bug with setting a texture on sampler, if an rendertarget swap occurs.``Since the shaders values are passed to device inside the apply() during the spritebatch operation, the, it appears by setting texture in s1 to null we are setting some dirty flag that isn't properly set when the rendertarget swap occurs.More information in the following link:_Edit:_ adds more details and example code</Description>

I use custom Skinned Model Processor and Animation Player based on XNA skinning sample (GPU). Please take a look at the FBX model:  It is created using 3D Stuio Max and is rendered well in both 3D Studio Max and official FBX Review software but when loaded in MonoGame and rendered using SkinnedEffect, model meshes are shifted and distorted. In Xna this model was rendering correctly.I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, have you any ideas?Thank you!</Description>

The fps remain at close to 60fps because it seems that the machine makes up for the loss by bunching more frames together.I also tried the exact same thing with the stopwatch in update, and the same thing happens there too.  This is not good at all for a game as it does cause large gaps in time where things glitch and look terrible.</Description>

    <Title>Possible OpenGL depth range / clipping bug</Title>
    <CreatedDate>25/03/2015</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>29/03/2015</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>It's very possible that I'm missing something obvious.But it seems to me that MonoGame does not account for the difference in NDC space between Direct3D and OpenGL.In Direct3D, the Z-coordinate in NDC ranges from 0 to 1, while in OpenGL it ranges from -1 to 1. So in Direct3D, anything in NDC space with `z &lt; 0` will be clipped, while in OpenGL anything in NDC space with `z &lt; -1` will be clipped.The `Matrix.CreateOrthographic*` and `Matrix.CreatePerspective` methods use Direct3D conventions, so the NDC depth range created by these methods is from 0 to 1.As far as I can see, that means that MonoGame's OpenGL renderer only ever uses half of the available depth range. Worse, near plane clipping doesn't work properly, because objects that _should_ be behind the near clip plane, and therefore clipped, in fact aren't, because the near clip plane ends up (potentially) behind the camera. (That's how I noticed this bug - something that should have been clipped wasn't being clipped.)The only mention I can find of this issue is over on FNA, here: flibitijibibo/FNA#282. @flibitijibibo mentioned a possible solution: `glClipControl`, and implemented it for FNA [here]( but it's only available in recent versions of OpenGL. You can also modify the `Matrix` methods that create projection matrices, but obviously that's not a general solution. @flibitijibibo has also added a note to the FNA docs about the issue, [here](But I feel like I must be missing something, because surely this would have been noticed before now?_(Note: MonoGame uses `posFixup` to account for the difference between Direct3D and OpenGL in the 0 location for the screen-space Y-coordinate. That's related to this, but it doesn't solve the NDC Z-coordinate problem.)_</Description>

    <Description>In Direct3D, there's an `ArraySize` property for textures, which I think would be really useful to expose:``OpenGL has [array textures]( which look like the same thing (although not supported by OpenGL ES 2.0).I think this could be a backwards-compatible change: if you want to `SetData` on one of these, you'd use the `level` parameter. You'd calculate the value for the `level` parameter using something similar to Direct3D's [D3D11CalcSubresource]( which we'd need to expose as a new API.If this looks like something that would be of interest, then I'd be happy to work on a PR. I just wanted to first see if it matches MG's goals.(My use-case: for cascaded shadow maps, it's nice to use a Texture2D array. The alternative is to use a single texture containing all the shadow maps, with offsets to sample from the correct cascade. It's certainly do-able without texture arrays, but more elegant with them.)</Description>

    <Description>When returning to a monogame game having received a call, the game screen displays, but updates do not resume. After about 10 seconds, the game crashes and returns to the home screen.This occurs in the latest stable monogame build and development versions from just before this point until now.Steps to reproduce:1) Create a new iOS Universal app in Xamarin studio2) Set up a standard "cornflower blue" game1 boilerplate class and update the AppDelegate and Main.cs files to run this.3) Modify the game1 update and draw calls so that the ongoing updates can be seen (I put in a simple timer to display gameTime.TotalGameTime on the draw call)4) Run the app (I was using an iPhone 5c running iOS 8.1)5) Call the phone running the app6) When the phone running the app switches to display the incoming call, hang up7) The phone running the app will now return to the app, but the display will no longer update. After about 10 seconds, the app will crash.</Description>

    <Description>Hi there,Am attempting simple port of the Kinect for Windows XNA sample over to monogame but ran into a hitch with the shader code.Was using the Monogame Pipeline GUI Tool, and out of the box, the .fx files wouldn't compile unless I updated the "compile ps_2_0" to "compile ps_4_0". However, once done so, the textures that XNA once rendered the depth and color streams to, now just show flickering homogenous colors.However, the skeleton renders fine. It doesn't use custom shaders, so it's great to know that everything else worked fine!Here is 1 shader code file:``Any further ideas or help?Thanks,Jaleno</Description>

    <Description>Hello,***I have started porting my existing game engine from Xna to MonoGame recently. The process goes well and MonoGame looks very good but I have faced some issues. I will create 1 bug per issue.MonoGame 3.3.0.2238&lt;b&gt;Issue 1: ModelMesh.Tag ignored in ContentManager.Load&lt;Model&gt;()&lt;/b&gt;I have custom model processor which uses Model.Tag, ModelMesh.Tag and ModelMeshPart.Tag properties to store custom data. In ContentMagager.Load&lt;Model&gt;(), Model.Tag and ModelMeshPart.Tag are loaded just fine but ModelMesh.Tag is simply ignored. Currently I use simple workaround storing ModelMesh.Tag data in the ModelMeshPart.Tag but honestly I do not see any point to ignore MedelMesh.Tag property and I think that is a bug.There are modelMeshPart.Tag = reader.ReadObject&lt;object&gt;();andmodel.Tag = reader.ReadObject&lt;object&gt;();assignments in theModelReader : ContentTypeReaderclass but there is no such assignment for the ModelMesh.Tag property.Thank you!</Description>

    <Description>If you create a lot of BasicEffects (1 at a time or in bulk) and then dispose them, there is pretty big memory leak. I've tried forcing GC.Collect() but it doesn't help. Somewhere, unmanaged memory is allocated but never released when you create BasicEffects.A simple demo is here - it allocates and then destroys 100 BasicEffects per frame, then calls a full GC. On Windows DirectX, it leaks 5-10 mb per second.(This is on MonoGame 3.2)</Description>

    <Description>As I tried to update to MonoGame 3.3 I encountered some strange behavior. I'm really unsure if this is a bug or me misusing something, but since it worked fine under 3.2 and fails in 3.3 now... My guess would be some different handling within the SpriteBatch class, but I have no idea of the actual Framework code at all.First of all: I'm using the "Advanced Zima 2D Shadows" (MonoGame version), compiled with the 3.3 Pipeline Tool on Windows and using the 3.2 assemblies of MonoGame (in my actual game) everything just worked fine:![tm_shader_working](Now I switched to the 3.3 assemblies and got this result (without any other changes):![tm_shader_failing](After some research I could narrow down the Problem to a 2x multi blend shader that doesn't seem to do it's job anymore.![tm_shader_failinginfo](As you can see the lightmap is still being created correctly, but the blending part just blackens everything out (I used my main SpriteBatch to simply draw the lightmap instead of blending it with the underlying texture as done in the first picture). In the actual code there is a separate SpriteBatch set to use the multi blend shader to draw both textures.Note: The rocks around the player/placeholder changed since I restarted/rebuilt the game each time and therefore the map was randomly rebuilt each time.Since I'm quite confused now whether it's my bad or not I couldn't help myself besides posting this as an issue here. I am working on a Linux platform and even tried the WinGL assembly, but I still got this (unwanted) result.The c# code where this issue occurs looks like this (completly from the shading system mentioned above):``Sorry, if this is my issue and not yours, but I don't quite understand shaders yet and I didn't make any changes except the assembly-version I use (both are marked as 3.1.2.0 though).Oh, while writing this I remembered: The "old" assembly was not the official 3.2 one. It was the one from the "MonoDevelop Alpha Add-In Package" (.mpack) that @cra0zy (or however his name is spelled, sorry) posted. I'm unsure which version this actually is since they are all marked as 3.1.2.0...</Description>

    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>Hi!when running a WP8.1 game, the orientation is not changed until several frames have passed since the start. It is a quite weird bug, because it seems it depends on the CPU load. It looks really bad because my loading screen is in portrait (while it should be in landscape) for the whole process.The problem can be reproduced very easily with the spinning cube example: Modify the draw function, and loop 1000 times the whole draw (except clear and base.Draw, of course).Running the example with a single draw makes the orientation turn as soon as it is started, but with the 1000 times loop, the device takes quite a time to turn orientation.</Description>

    <Description>Running on 32 bit WIndows 7 got;2MGFX.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.Looking at the code it seems MojoShader.cs is hardcoded withconst string mojoshader_dll = "libmojoshader_64.dll";I can build a 32 bit version by adding libmojoshader_32.dll to the project and changing the hardcoded line above and then changing the build target to "Any CPU"Would need to check the sizeof a UINT to determine which dll to load at runtime and probably update protobuild files to update the project details for a proper solution.</Description>

    <Title>Mouse position bug under High DPI on Windows</Title>
    <CreatedDate>05/01/2015</CreatedDate>
    <ClosedDate>25/03/2015</ClosedDate>
    <IssueLabels />
    <Description>My "FPS camera" code, that constantly resets the mouse position to the centre of the window, worked in XNA but doesn't (quite) work in MonoGame. It _sometimes_ works, but other times, if you leave the mouse stationary, it still thinks the mouse is moving by 1 pixel in the X or Y direction.I've tracked the problem down to DPI scaling. If I set my DPI scaling to 100%, there's no problem. But with 150% scaling, there seems to be a problem with mouse position getting rounded. I haven't looked into it yet, but I guess that somewhere between setting the mouse position and retrieving it, there's a float getting rounded to an int, or something, which means MonoGame constantly thinks that the mouse has moved by a little bit, even if it hasn't.I'll work on a pull request for this, but I wanted to raise this issue first in case anyone else has experienced this issue. Do any MonoGame developers have DPI scaling enabled on their monitors?</Description>

When I try to build I get an error that PrimitiveType does not exist in the namespace "OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL".  This error occurs on line 18 of file GraphicsDevice.OpenGL.cs on the linux build.

    <Description>I'm not sure if I'm right about this, which is why I'm creating an issue, not a pull request. If it is indeed a bug, then I can create a pull request.It seems to me that this line is wrong:I think we should remove the null check, and always set the texture, even if it is null.For example, if the previously bound texture is a TextureCube (well, Texture2D array, in Direct3D 11 terminology), and the new texture is a Texture2D, but it just happens to be null, then it's still necessary to set that texture slot to null, otherwise Direct3D will complain that the currently bound texture has the wrong dimension for the current shader. (I have this exact situation, which is how I found this.)</Description>

    <Description>I have a ContentProcessor that dynamically builds an effect file, and then calls `BuildAndLoadAsset` like this:``I've debugged it, and found that `options.OutputFile` is an empty string, which causes the crash in ShaderInfo.cs:L81.The root of the problem seems to be that in `PipelineProcessorContext.BuildAndLoadAsset`, it creates a `PipelineBuildEvent` but doesn't set `DestFile` to anything.</Description>
